      "I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly \"\"encyclopedic\"\" about bad writing. The bit about Yahweh is directly from Tyson's acknowledgement of error on Facebook, btw, where he still shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of Bush's Biblical quotation is.   \"\n",

The invasion and the SEOs should definitely be the primary focus for the project to begin with as then it'll be easier to build the behemoth Yugoslav Front article with summarized bits.

Alexander was a popular name at this time. This of course does not mean that Jesus was given a Greek name rather than a Hebrew name, or a \"\"Hellenized\"\" Hebrew name, when he was born.

One website suggests that a student parent committee selected Brookwood’s colors and mascott. This is completely untrue. No adults were involved in voting for the school colors or mascott. Adults had suggested the Brookwood Bears and the color of Carolina Blue , but in a 3-0 vote the student committee led by Michael E. Schmidt selected the Bronco and the colors burgandy and gold. The Brookwood school song and fight song were selected by Dr. Michael E. Schmidt and Brookwood’s first band director the late Stewart Hughes. Laura Zieker BHS’ first choir teacher wrote the words to Brookwood’s school song. Both songs were based upon the songs from Tucker High School. Dr. Michael E. Schmidt arranged the first arrangement of Brookwood High School’s fight song. The BHS administration had originally wanted Brookwood’s colors to be Orange and Blue like the Denver Broncos, but the student committee led by a Parkview High School student [ hs senior Dr. Schmidt] rejected those colors because they are the same colors as Brookwood’s rival Parkview High School. [ Both of the two other students on that committe were junior transfers from South Gwinnett HS] The colors chosen were maroon and gold which were based upon the colors of Florida State University. The runner-up choice for Brookwood’s color was Carolina blue. The original Brookwood HS logo/mascott selected by the three student committee was a full bronco surrounded by a horseshoe. The current logo is that of a bronco head. The second choice for the school mascot was a bear.\n",

Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting \"\"is a person of Jewish descent\"\" into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a \"\"race\"\" only.

However, in this case it does bring up an issue of verifiability concerning the initial secondary source (Fallon) per WP:VERIFY.  So this is problem of two policies conflicting to which I believe there is a solution.  I assume that such problems are not uncommon.  I'll look into it and get back to you.

      "How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself. Some of them you didn't even put back right, hence the friendly notice left on your talk page; you still have some DAB links left. How is this clearer and who does that? Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves... but worse. I don't get it. I followed your dance-style-on-the-card rule and I added wikilinks which weren't there before. We were on the SAME SIDE Snow. We both want a better page. Pay attention. If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you, all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo, tango, b-boying, and kalinka (they all linked to disam pages). Then everything would have linked fine. Instead you undo everything I linked. Then you (re)add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before. You even linked to some pages which aren't even helpful. Example: you changed \"\"Tap dance\"\" back to \"\"Tap dancing\"\" and \"\"Krumping\"\" back to \"\"Krump\"\". The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects (not because I'm being subjective). But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects. It's not like your helping people in their understanding. All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles. How petty is that. Take Bollywood for another example. Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs? Not to mention the fact that there's also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article. How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit. If you really didn't like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance this time. Either way, at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations. Stop being selfish and think about the readers.\n",

      "By-the-way, regardless of how the show presents street dance, \"\"old school\"\" is two words and breaking will always be hip-hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. That's a fact and not subjective. Read a book, watch a documentary, or educate yourself some other way if you don't want to hear me out. I'm going to change \"\"old school\"\" back to two words because it's good grammar. I'm also going to remove electric boogie, take African out of the jazz dance group, and fix all the disambiguation links you added. Then I'll either make pas de duex it's own row again or put lyrical hip-hop back beside hip-hop. Or maybe do both. Or maybe not even touch them. I haven't decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option. I don't know what you would settle with. Any other changes I make won't be without good reason. I think I've demonstrated that by my long-winded response to your comments. If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them. At that point, I'll just go to WP:RFC and solicit the opinions of people who don't care about either of us or SYTYCD because I'm not about to argue back-and-forth on this talk page with you considering that you don't WP:OWN the page, you have no sources, and more importantly, you have no WP:CONSENSUS about a rule you made up which you yourself reneged on.

I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all. Second of all, I'm of English and Spaniard descent who is sensitive to the falsehoods thus far stated in wiki pages concerning the English and Spaniards. For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary. There must be an appeals board within Wiki to whom I can supplicate my case. I hope that you understand my position. I look forward to making wiki a fair and informative base of knowledge.

As you had known, I sat beside Arturo D. Brion's wife, my seat and classmate Antonietta from 1978-1982, Ateneo Law School. And I accepted God's will for me as closed Catholic amid my strong faith when I predicted the Supreme Court appointment of Brion as the Benjamin of the Court, way back on 2003 when I can't forget the pansit canton the spouses served me in Pandacan, Manila, so memorable. And Arturo D. Brion, signed the final Court resolution which put the final nail to my judicial career's coffin on June 3, 2008, exactly 25 years from June 3, 1983, when LUIS, Armand and Angel, holy angels of God first faced destiny and me-my brother Robert. Judge and Justice Brion are our icon. I had continuously prayed Psalm 109 as you noted in your email to me. Peace of Christ!

      "Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. There is some quackery out there (like pills that contain w-9 because olive oil is cheap) but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking, actually, unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly.  BTW, there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. This destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all PUFAs. On such a diet, even DOGS get severe atherosclerosis, and they are species highly resistant to it (their HDLs are higher than their LDLs). So all this is quite fascinating.  \"\n",

I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by \"\"Super King Air\"\", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two \"\"families\"\", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  \"\n",

      "First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a \"\"Serb nationalist talking point\"\", a \"\"thinly veiled political advocacy\"\", and an \"\"unverified Serbian name claim\"\", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is \"\" tendentious & unreferenced\"\". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your \"\"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page\"\" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  \"\n",

You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? \"\"I'm not saying that your entirely wrong\"\" Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino.

      "It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be\n",

However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is \"\"evolution\"\" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.

      "Hi again, I've done some Google searches, and it seems that the term Mad Mel is a nickname used to describe her either on blogs or in the comments sections of blogs within the context of really quite foul attacks on her \"\"Mad Mel’s a raving fuckwad\"\" etc etc. Yes these are sources, but extremely unreliable ones. It actually looks as though the two sources above may be the best, but there are still problems with those. I still think the term should be avoided as a clear ad hominem attack and a clear violation of BLP. I also think that the term is used by people who are made to feel uncomfortable by the challenging questions that she raises, and rather than engage her on those questions, they resort to cheap insults, but that is just my suspicion, and not entirely relevant here.

      "No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the \"\"other clergy\"\" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why \"\"Benedict XVI\"\" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation \"\"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus\"\", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop \"\"Pope\"\" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch. Even in the unlikely situation that someone arrived here from \"\"Random article\"\" and momentarily thought he was still pope, that would be cured immediately by the lead, the resignation section, and the discussion of his pontificate in the past tense.

      "Support - This has developed into more than an uprising, how much blood has to spill before the folks who oppose the name change can call this a war? Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country. Why now and not earlier? This is another sign that things are getting worse. I believe the United States has enough intelligence in the country to know what's going, war has started and it was time for the U.S. to get any Americans in the country out of harms way.\n",

Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.\n",

      "\n",
      "What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.\n",

But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... \"\"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)\"\"\n",

In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.\n",

That is, I believe there should be a preference to use usual English names, while you appear to have a preference for the default romanization. It seems to me, that \"\"Star City\"\" is the English name for this region - whether incorporated or not. Notice on other language Wikipedias, including the Russian Wikipedia, they don't have two articles on the area.. after all, the Russian names are the same. Maybe there's a dispute here on English Wikipedia because the English name (the one originally used by NASA) is different from the default transliteration (just like Korolev / Korolyov).  \n",

      "Basically, I think the definition of \"\"conventional English name\"\" in WP:RUS isn't quite compatible with the usage in WP:COMMONNAME. In particular, WP:COMMONNAME doesn't require the sources to be \"\"dictionaries\"\". But WP:RUS does require the sources to be dictionaries, and I believe this difference is causing problems. WP:RUS is not a key Policy or Guideline (maybe it's more like a WikiProject advice page, that achieved wide support in 2007); as such it should elaborate on the key policies, not change them. I think the \"\"dictionary\"\" requirement should be reworded, to allow for situations where the place name doesn't occur in a dictionary, but can still has a conventional English name.\n",

This means the values in the parentheses eg (15) could be used for the purpose of calculation, but any value that results from such a calculation would not be more accurate than the number of significant figures if those in parentheses were not considered. In other words, the values in parentheses are there to help avoid rounding errors if you’re trying to work to the limit of accuracy of the gas constant.

And the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed...  Also one thing I have to add here: do you know anything about the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008 and the role of L. Kaczynski there? Do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders (Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia), went to Tbilisi and forced Russian army to stop the attack on Georgia?

Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.\n",
      "\n",
      "''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.\n",

Ultimately, IW and PD are billed last in the credits, so they should be listed last here if the general consensus is to use billing order for listing the cast.  That's the great thing about these discussion pagesit allows for differences of opinion to be expressed and consensus reached.

      "The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.\n",

      "When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.\n",

      "It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.\n",

The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost?

A study done by some British company found that aviation primary RADAR systems have difficulty handling windfarms as the constantly rotating turbines cause the RADAR to pick up an intrusive object. There are complex ways of eliminating this problem but at the moment it is being cited by aviation safety organisations that wind farms pose a significant risk to their industry. I would also argue that the title is misleading as the intermittent nature of wind and the economic cost of wind turbines are not environmental issues.\n",

It looks to me that I was correct:  At the time, Dodo was not responding, but that was NOT because he 'isn't at his computer'.  Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.  At the time (January 3), you got away with claiming that I was being 'impatient', because it was at least plausible that Dodo wasn't at his computer.

A corollary of existence existing is that each existing informed mind must think for itself.  So, perhaps you thought I meant that the individual is the final 'creator' of reality.  This is not so.  Regardless of how fleshed out your criteria becomes, criterion by criterion, I must still have to agree with the content of this organizations decisions on who Rand is and what she left to posterity.  If I didn't do so, acting as the final arbitrator of my existence (or my interaction within reality) who will?  Existence and existents hold the validity (or lack thereof) of my perceptions, my concepts, my decisions, consequences of my ethics, etc.  Not Wikipedia.  Certainly not you who thinks such a thought nonsense.  And I have all her texts, I'm quite aware of her ideas. Making assumptions without checking on premises is what landed Rand's page in this editing nightmare.  Also, Rand didn't form the thought Existence exists (existence qua existence) or A is A, Aristotle did.  She resurrected the import of the phrase and logically extended the consequences.

      "Vojvodina was Serbia, but also was Hungary post 1867. Problem with this article is that it speaks from just one contex, while ignoring the others (for Hungarians living in Vojvodina prior to 1920 Vojvodina was nothing less than Hungary). I think that solution to this is obvius. First, there should be a prefix Serbian in the title, as this article obviously talks about formation and creation of entity of Serbian Voivodina, and not about other entities (kingdom of Hungary,lands of Hungarian counts) which existed in the region. Second it should have link to another article Vajdaság, which should explain history of Hungarian people in that region the same as this article is centered about Serbian people. Would that be ok?\n",

      "Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.\n",
      "Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.\n",
      "The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said \"\"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,\"\" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.\n",
      "All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) \n",
      "Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase \"\"Legend in his own mind\"\". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject.

The reality was that there was only a handful of Templars in Scotland at the time the Order was dissolved, and Robert I was not about to risk further papal censure by interfering.

I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.  \"\n",

I have sent Wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that I am not self-promoting. My mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article, which I’ll do as soon as I have the time. My intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals, are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important, and, having spent two years researching the topic, I can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information  try to find out what Earthquake Victims Memorial Day is in Armenia and you’ll see what I mean. It is my intent to self-publish the book within 6 months if I cannot find a publisher. Meanwhile, feel free to delete my articles as desired. I’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after I’ve ascertained that I am, in fact, doing it right.

      "ok... that's fine you can take the U.S out of that part ,but if a device is released the following year or later it is  considered its SUCCESSOR hence why someone would put !st or 2nd etc..because you't have 2 deices be called absolutely the same thing because they're not , they have different hardware , software and spec and its from the same maker and family model hence why its referenced as 1st gen etc etc...so how do you explain apple's devices? lol...the clealy release a new iphone every year and other hardware makers do so as well..the word generation means something or someone of the same family but with newer hardware released or born later..in hardware its usually a yearly thing..but if you prefer a model number which is more specific i'm willing to compromise that, the point is you can't name it the smae thing if its not the same exact product, you have to put something to tell them apart and i don't think its enough to just put a year the said model was released (xxxx), but ok fine, but i know others would disagree with you because what makes this device different from other devices that apple releases and has them in generation order its in the apple ios devices article in wiki itself and apple calls its products by generation and names, its a matter of being as  specific as possible so users wont get confused and know exactly what something is, its extremely helpful to many, you might not think so but and many others do especially if a device maker calls its products of different models released in the future the same thing, then how can you tell them apart if you call for example all      your phones samsung galaxy, but they don't, not usually but the best way to know is to put the model number..i mean i on't know your way of logic but you are contradicting the way a lot of articles i seen have been done here and yes i know you do things different, so do i, as far as i'm concerned most of the tech world and device makers refer to the products of their same family but released later as generations besides having different names and model names...but the thing for example..Amazon Fire TV, guess what what? you go to the website of it and its called the SAME THING, most people wouldn't know the 1 in the website is the newer  \"\"2nd GEn\"\" model because there was the original or first gen model came out last year...i mean most of the tech world follow this trend..you have to put something to tell things apart from 1 another, whether its a name, model #, the generation it is etc ...that's why i put that because it is true, go look it up and read articles about it, when they compare that model to the 1 last year its referred as 1st and 2nd gen models by the  industry at times to tell them apart , most don't know there was a previous model of the amazon fire tv, the average consumer isn't tech savvy, i am, i love technology and you have to be as specific as possible so readers know exactly what something is  i mean yes i know amazon.com doesn't have their 2014 and 2015 amazon firetv microconsoles with 1 or 2 next to them to tell the apart.. and i did put parenthesis when i put 1st and 2nd gen on them) meaning that's not part of its name ...its put there so people know what is what..that's one of the purposes or parenthesis, it looks like you're being very picky and stalkish a bit, because i told you how i felt you are looking into every single edit i ever made to point out errors or disagreements ? lol..that's a little low and immature don't you think? the way i'm editing hasn't been an issue for the readers, i know the appreciate my efforts, probable better than some of the editors here, how many times you or your brethren going to be harassing me on this huh? what you are doing is called HARASSMENT and i would know, besides the fact i'm a LAW STUDENT and tech savvy but i'm not gonna get in a debate over nonsense...there's nothing wrong with my edits other than being more informative and most of all COMPLETE, i don't leave blank spaces and little info, i put 110% of everything i do especially in my edits...stop harassing me and sending me nonsense notes on little insignificant things...if i change a letter of a misspelling you guys going to make a big deal about that too? i try to follow the standards as best i could and as far as i'm concerned i'm doing absolutely nothing wrong and i'm well within my rights.. STOP HARASSING ME , you or your other acolytes (yes i said acolytes) with little nonsense, if i was doing something terribly wrong i would be getting complaints from readers or editors 24 /7...what you and your other associates are doing is called harassment, i'm not doing nothing wrong i just have a different more complete and thorough way of doing things so refrain from messaging me every 5 seconds of nonsense and stop stalking, its creepy and in some cases...ILLEGAL but alright i won't put U.S  on it because well some products do get released in the same continent the same day but i pu\n",

I had hoped that enough of you guys would understand the importance of defining time, on the outset, as these two different (and not really competing) definitions, first as a phenomenon (where I drew every word out of the dictionary references, including \"\"indefinite\"\" and \"\"existence\"\", etc.) and then as a measurement (what Steve Quinn likes to call the \"\"operational\"\" definition).  And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; \"\"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater\"\".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.  But the status quo isn't better than what existed before and since I was unsuccessful (even though everything is solidly referenced) in convincing you, I'll let it go.  Unless SQ or JW try to crap up the lede again, then I'll be back, and the rest of us also should be vigilant.  Maybe someday, this will be a good article.  But no matter how well the rest of the article is done, if the lede is crappy, the article as a whole cannot be \"\"good\"\".\n",

When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.\n",

      "I am really puzzled by the confusion that remains here. First, people need to know that the term prophet is used in two ways by the LDS. In essence, any individual who is given revelation which is pertinent to the future is acting prophetically. Thus, any individual (in or out of the Church) might prophecy and thereby be referred to as a small-'p' prophet. However, some individuals are formally ordained (by laying on of hands) as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Thus, Brother Jones may be a Bishop, a High Priest, an Apostle, and a Prophet at the same time (we actually have 15 prophets if you wish to pursue the issue). Unique to the LDS belief is the understanding that the authority of Priesthood offices are retained, based on worthiness, forever. So while Joseph Smith acted prophetically, he also held the titles of, Elder, Apostle, Prophet, President, and High Priest. It could also be said he was a Deacon, a Teacher, and a Priest. These are titles. In fact, broken down by office and (common usage)\n",

But it is insensitive to both the RLDS and the LDS and erroneous to ignore the fact Joseph Smith was a 'P'rophet (an office in the High Priesthood).

I am astonished at the inconsistency with which certain Wikipeida editors attribute credibility to different sources on child sexual abuse. The Eberles' history with child pornography is in the public domain and it has been for almost twenty years. Now we find editors claiming that the Eberles (and John Earle, a contributor their book) are considered credible sources, whilst all sources (including major newspapers, magazines and a trial judge) indicating that they are child pornographers are not credible sources.\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.\n",

      "I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as \"\"avatar\"\"). The term preceding your edits, \"\"simulated reality,\"\" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.\n",
      "\n",
      " You added most of this: \"\"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs.

Hence, I'm changing this to \"\"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,\"\" with \"\"mind children\"\" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:\n",

      "\"\"A prophet will the Lord, thy God raise unto thee, a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.\"\" Deuteronomy 18:15 \n",
      "The false prophet, the navi sheker, the \"\"madman\"\" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: \"\"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",
      "Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - \"\"altering\"\" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this \"\"imitation\"\" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",
      "The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive \"\"from the midst of thee\"\" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: \"\"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.\"\" As it says: \"\"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.\"\" Deuteronomy 13:1. \n",
      "\"\"A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.\"\" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known.

You should cite more than just you think it is and explain specifically why you think that it is. There are many other Wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many different things, one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts. These articles include titles like, rapist, criminal, pedophile, murderer, thief, organized crime boss and many others. Just look at the OJ Simpson article, it makes reference to accusations against him for murder in the first sentence. Where this title is seems to be at issue for some reason. Wikipdeia articles are usually vastly different in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in different places throughout the articles. Since there is no debate as to whether Roman Polanski is a rapist or not, and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie career should it not be included in the first sentence? Is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed? Should a person's most prominent title be their career, their ethnicity, place of origin, or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life? What specific guideline specifies this? Should it merely be what the person is best known for, because Roman Polanski is very well known for having raped a 13 year old girl and for being a movie director. Many people would say he is not known for his acting as he has few notable roles, or writing as he has written very little, but these titles appear in the first sentence of his article.\"\n",

It is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable, and personally I don't agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been around since 2007, Jeh has been around since 2005, and Dsimic has been editing a lot since 2013 (in other words, enough to get a very good idea of how Wikipedia's anarchist system works). I'm glad that Jeh prefaced his statement with \"\"in my opinion\"\" because that's what Wikipedia is about, and no personal statement (or even an essay such as commonly-cited arguments to avoid essay) is law. We debate a lot. I know just how much sucks but it's the way it is. Now, whether or not product lists are not-so-good articles is (debatably, if you you're axiologically inclined) an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users, or our editors if they're not your priority. In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. Lists in general are not easy candidates for \"\"good articles\"\"; as I recall, back around 2008 or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories, but when I pointed to WP:CSL, the steam was taken out even though that didn't change the sensibility of the decisions.

      "\n",
      "I've discovered that not only fractional iteration is possible, but also complex iteration. It's not as intuitive as fractional iteration, but it does make sense once you have a new model for what iteration means. Probably the simplest explanation is with orbitals in the complex plain: iterating to a real values generates the complex orbitals as paths. Iterating to imaginary powers, meanwhile, generates paths perpendicular to the orbitals at every point. You need the entire vector field of orbitals to know the new path. For example, iterating a linear function (multiplying by a constant) creates orbitals which are rays. Iterating to imaginary powers creates paths with are concentric circles. After that, complex iteration can be done by composing real and imaginary values. For a more precise derivation, I had to invent a new type of derivative, it looks at the instantaneous change in value at a point as the function iterates. The formula for this derivative is: \n",
      "f*(x) = lim n->0 (fn(x) - x)/n\n",
      "Which is equivalent to the derivative of f's Abel function. The key about this derivative is it has the property that fn* = f x n . This enables iteration to imaginary powers to be calculated directly. Ultimately I think it is equivalent to taking the analytic extension of the Abel function, but it's a bit more intuitive than Taylor series witchcraft. I've done the calculations to arrive at Euler's identity using this method rather than the typical one, and graphically it makes much more sense: once it's understood how complex iteration works, it's just geometry to find the imaginary value e must be raised to in order to complete the arc from 1 to -1.\n",

      "Hi, thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on Bridget Taylor. A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a \"\"fan\"\" of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear\n",

The thing that bothers me is: how do I install it on the camera, in practice (I hate it when there's no info on the internet about that..)?

Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji.

Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings.

Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered.

He could've meant some Itinerant groups in Europe like for instance the Irish Travellers or maybe some Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups. I know Robert Plant is from the UK, and I've heard that British people usually don't use the word \"\"gypsy\"\" when speaking about Romani people, but they use it when speaking about people who lead itinerant life. Any conformation that Plant used it in terms of his Romani ethnic origin?   \"\n",

      "Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this, that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called \"\"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. \n",
      "And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion to Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.\n",

Why call it it the \"\"neurosurgical prank\"\" if there is no physical basis? From SEP: Inverted Qualia, it appears (though they don't reference the \"\"prank\"\" specifically) that the prank was probably designed (by Block and Fodor?) to refute functionalism, not physicalism.

Secondly, I'm not prepared to be trapped by yourself into 'naming and shaming' (Undoubtedly leading to you manipulating wiki policy to get me permanently blocked), its pretty self evident to all but the most deceitful who and what I'm referring to. Academics have always written in encyclopedias because encyclopedias are written by experts in their field. In huge editions many hundred may be involved. Even thousands. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography for example has over 100 historians writing entries (Thats an estimate, its probably more) So there is no doubt that if academics were recruited like any other scholarly project then an internet encyclopedia would be written quite easily. Fourthly, I have nothing to contribute to this article, other than the fact that encyclopedias do not use footnotes, and if they did, they certainly wouldn't have more than 60 for a relatively minor topic. Fifthly, academics have less time on their hands because they lead busy lives. The sort of people that obsess over wikipedia certainly do not.\n",

Platitude or not, there is very little that is new, but increasingly novel ways of looking at old things.  For me, this is key.  Whether it is necessary or not, a positive outlook helps one recognize serendipity and solve problems.  That's what is meant by a sagacious state of mind.  How does a negative outlook help Wikipedia?  Do we have good reason to avoid a positive outlook and discourage sagacity?  Here's a relevant encyclopedic platitude: it's not how big it is, it's how you use it.  How should we use Wikipedia?  How will it be used in the future?

      "I recently established a page for Sadie Benning's video \"\"Girl Power\"\". I've been notified that the page was challenged for its presumed insignificance (not enough \"\"notability\"\"). Considering the fact that feminist artists have been excluded from the mainstream art establishment and essentially omitted from history, I understand why one might thing a page dedicated to one of Sadie Benning's video MIGHT NOT have \"\"enough notability\"\". However, I would easily respond by mentioning that ALL of Sadie Benning's video, ESPECIALLY her video \"\"Girl Power\"\", played a pivotal role in the formation of Girl Power as a concept, radical feminist politics, and the Riot grrrl's commitment to the child icon. This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology. If Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedic database that indexes \"\"notable\"\" historical and current events, then it would only make sense to include a page on this highly influential work that has greatly contributed to the emergence of feminist 90s politics and art. Any attempts to delete this page will be excluding important information about a widely-acclaimed video that has ONLY been excluded from historical documentation databases because of the artist's sex.\"\n",

      "(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: \n",
      "\n",
      "Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called \"\"volunteer system.\"\"  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further \"\"editing\"\" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a \"\"terrible person you are.\"\"  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of \"\"vandalism\"\" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw \"\"vandalism\"\" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a \"\"disarming\"\" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As\n",

For these segments, he is also provided a rifle (does someone give him a rifle at the beginning of each segment?), the functionality of which changes with the kind of ammunition being used (how so?, also maybe \"\"changes depending on the ammunition used\"\"). The car driving (\"\"driving\"\", \"\"car\"\" is implied) segments (segmentsX2) usually involve Jak racing against time (prose, try \"\"have specific time constraints\"\") to complete a mission (that is what one does with missions), while defending himself against other cars (cars attack people?) or giant Metal Heads (?).

What you suggest, some form of moral policing I suppose, is utterly wrong. Who would determine what reliable sources are reporting in a way seemingly transphobic? Also, I believe there is a previous administrative action case of Wikipedians describing fellow editors asIslamophobic, because it's very close to a personal attack (especially as some people felt it concerns commenting another editor's mental state, an accusation of a medical phobia).

If you have a problem with centuries being spelled out (nineteenth and twentieth instead of 19th and 20th) you probably shouldn't have pointed to a policy (WP:CENTURY) that allows either form (in this case spelling it out) only requiring that usage be consistent. Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already \"\"internally consistent\"\" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing. If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page.  This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless.

Duh, that's what happens in Discussion pages about religious denominations and political candidacies. Your action and your comments here are almost astute, but not quite: The article about Temple Lot was created by a member of the Temple Lot faction, Jared Smith, and and has been constructively edited by his older brother Jordan Smith, who is also an active member of the Temple Lot faction. Not a \"\"former member\"\" or an \"\"excommunicated\"\" member, but a full baptised member, \"\"in good standing\"\" according to the bylaws and official documentation both within and outside the faction. Due mainly to the machinations and malice of an anonymous editor, Good Ol'factory (whom you know perfectly well is the same as the Snocrates/Zoporific who began unconstructively editing the Temple Lot articles in December 2007), both Temle Lot members/Wikipedia Editors Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have been unfairly and abusively banned from editing Wikipedia. Specifically, Administrator Versageek banned Jordan Smith on December 17, 2007 because he kept complaining about Snocrates/Good Ol'factory's misconduct, and then when Snocrates-turned  Good Ol'factory was finally granted administrative privileges, he deleted jsmith51389's user page, which contained a clear explanation of what had happened in December 2007. Duh, that's what dishonest persons do, to hide their misconduct from review: they censor it. I'm mildly curious what pompous and unreasonable and unfair and abusive reply or action you will come up with in reply here, but I'm not terribly curious, seeing as how it's rather predictable whatever pompous, self-rightous \"\"authorities\"\" do when their misconduct is brought to light: Slander the person or persons who bring the misconduct to light, that's what they do.  Nice try, but no cigar, sir. The truth about the Latter-day Saint Movement, and the fascinating role Hedrickites such as Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have played in it, will come to light, whether you, or Snocrates/Good Ol'Factory or any other pious geek, wishes otherwise.

      "To speak of the \"\"scramble for Africa\"\" is to begin a debate centuries old. In the words of Robert Collins, \"\"The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous.  The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous.  To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa.\"\"Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7\n",

      "By 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers.  Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond \"\"small coastal enclaves.\"\" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301  But from the years of 1880-1900, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, an independent state partly settled by African Americans; and Orthodox Christian Ethiopia (known to Europeans as \"\"Abyssinia\"\"). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe.  Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm.  They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price.  Britain promoted the idea of \"\"free trade\"\" in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa.  Britain had no worries until the 1860's when \"\"France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing.\"\" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301 \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to.  many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they \"\"provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans.\"\"Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7  The creation of the Suez Canal \"\"not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy.\"\"ibid., 7 Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, \"\"military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe.  Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage.\"\" John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800, second edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 7\n",

      "But a new world, as noted above, had begun.  Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa.

Within the hubris of the European nations was the ideal of \"\"national prestige,\"\" an idea that holding African colonies would increase the power of a nation.Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 303 New technology as well in the form of the \"\"repeater rifle\"\" and the \"\"maxim-gun\"\" gave Europeans new advantages over Africa.

IF you really think that that news report has relevance to the article, please expound your arguments hereinafter. I shall be most glad to see them. My view is that simply citing Putin on the missiles is quite meaningless, without experts′ analysis or at least commentary. This is a rather arcane and non-transparent subject. 40 new missiles announced (mind you, not put in service, but merely announced as a plan). So what? Is this more than last year, or fewer than prior? What meaning does it have, if it has any at all? Russia still has a largely Soviet-era nuclear arsenal, ergo, most of its ballistic missiles are technically past the expiry date and RF has been supposed to DEcommission hundreds of missiles each year for the past 20 years or so (which is not to say it has been doing it!). Meanwhile, as far as is publicly known, it has been commissioning about half a dozen, or a dozen on a good year. Thus overall, its nuclear arsenal has steadily shrunk. So far there is no info that this decline has been reversed. If SUCH news appears, THAT'll be relevant and notable!\n",

Concerning your request for protection of Paul Harvey and allowing only certain people access to the page, such an action is impossible with the MediaWiki software, as protection would block out every user but administrators. Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece. I'm going to see if I can find someone else to expand on this a little bit more, but on the mean time I will add the article to my watchlist and revert any vandalism or additions of unsourced material to help out, per WP:BIO.

Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.\n",

Forget the Magyarisation terms. and now a little summary of your claim (try to concentrate):  There was full education in language X (like in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Croatia) and the government saw that (and this is your claim and is not true, because the same would apply to the neighbouring countires) the minorities start to lose their language. As a result it decided to restrict education in language X (you say to a few subjects, I say de-facto to 2 hours a week - but it does not matter), because there was \"\"no need\"\" to teach some subjects in their language (which is a sociolinguistic non-sense). This is an illogical and actually chauvinist statement. What any normal government should do in such situation (wrongly claimed by you) is AT LEAST not restrict education in the language. Secondly, bilingual schools are no minority schools. Minority schools are only schools were the full language of education is the given language. Therefore the minority schools were literally shut down. This holds by definition and cannot be subject to any exaggeration.    \n",

Surely, even the most ardent supporter of animal rights can see that this is simply supposed to be a list of material facts about an aspect of human behavior that has existed in one form or another since the dawn of time?  There are many other places on Wikipedia where they can read and contribute their individual viewpoints on the ethical, moral and practical points of animal consumption.  I do not wish to enter into personal attacks, and will not on an individual level, but there seem to be quite a few people who are either too stupid or too self-centered to leave their personal opinions out of an encyclopedia article.  Can anyone imagine opening a copy of an Encyclopedia Britannica to the \"\"Slaughterhouses\"\" entry only to find a jumbled mess of a few verifiable facts mixed in with opinions and hysterical rants about how terrible are slaughterhouses and meat eaters?  Why can't these people understand that this is simply a webpage that is attempting to describe what is a slaughterhouse, what it does, where they operate, how they operate, and what types of animals they process?  There would be no opinions stating that slaughterhouses are wonderful, desirable places that exist for the pleasure of some sadistic monsters who kill simply for the pleasure of it.  Likewise, there will not be any sections condemning slaughterhouses and all people who either work there or utilize the products that are produced in such a place.  This article, once completed satisfactorily, will simply be a repository of verifiable facts about slaughterhouses, their genesis, their necessity (as it stands right now in our modern world), and their operating procedures.  Yes, there will be facts about the historical conditions, including, I am sure, mention of Upton Sinclair's \"\"The Jungle.\"\"  Also, there will most likely be a small section that notes these vegetarians' and vegans' attitudes and activities concerning slaughterhouses.  In this aforementioned small section, I can imagine that there will be external links leading to Wikipedia pages that support these vegetarians' and vegans' points of view.  Now, what is wrong with that?  A place for everything, and everything in its place?  Oh, and if you are still confused about what is a fact and what is an opinion, an \"\"opinion\"\" is explained in detail on a (what else?) Wikipedia page residing here: \"\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion,\"\" and it says something like this, for starters: \"\"1. An opinion is a subjective statement or thought about an issue or topic, and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts...\"\"  NOW do you see the difference?

      "I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he \"\"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice\"\" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.    \n",

      "Dammit people, at least let me talk. I believe Thrindel is not editing these pages on the interest of creating a neutral page that informs about all aspects of this comic and its creator. By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here. There is room for both praise and criticism on the page, if you can find good sources of either that is. Here is one thing I have noticed about the latest comic (although I fear it falls under original research and could not be posted): http://images.google.com/images?q=home+depot+shopper (fifth picture) and http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20080321 This confirms one thing I already knew: Tim uses blurred images copied hastily off of google image search for his backgrounds. Personally, I would expect an artist to do his own art if they expect not to be criticized, but what do I know? 71.13.86.232\n",

      "I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, citing a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example.\n",
      "The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 reverts - he actually put \"\"rv#1, rv#2, rv#3...\"\" in his edit summaries - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious \"\"kamikaze edit warrior\"\" with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reservist with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanctions, of course - that's reserved for people who say \"\"fuck\"\" or click \"\"undo\"\" four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspire in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalism they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon.\n",
      "The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface \"\"huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and/or by Arab military forces\"\" claiming it supported his text, \"\"the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord.\"\" He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincingly refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company.\n",
      "This is not an anomaly. Just prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title \"\"Israeli-Gazan conflict\"\" or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that \"\"other Palestinian estimates differ\"\" from the \"\"Hamas-run\"\" Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative \"\"home team\"\" Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall fatalities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specifics.) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about \"\"incivility\"\" and \"\"personal attacks\"\" when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. What can I say, my patience is not unlimited.\n",
      "I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Satanic monster. I respect Steve/sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him!) Hell, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, dissemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Deal with it.\n",

      "(I note with irony my own advice to a newbie: Try and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against \"\"incivility\"\" from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid \"\"mainstream\"\" sources. [...] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. Don't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you. Even when you know full well that somebody is lying, just say, \"\"I'm afraid I can't understand how you read the source material in that way: it clearly says XYZ...\"\" WP doesn'\n",

I added this to the personal information about Bethmann-Hollweg, along with a link to a PDF of the article in the New York Times.  All I said was that according to this article, he was of Jewish extraction. That is a demonstrably, undeniably true statement!  It definitely was stated in an AP report that appeared in the New York Times that Bethmann-Hollweg was of Jewish descent.  Why then would somebody keep removing this reference?  GoodMorningWorld has done this several times. He claims that it is CERTAINLY not true, but IT IS CERTAIN that the AP said it and that it appears in the New York Times.  If GoodMorningWorld has some argument that the claim in the AP story was wrong then he should post it in the text of the article along with the claim.  Otherwise he appears to be trying to censor information that he finds disagreeable. Who the hell does he think he is?  \n",

I do not think that this kind of dogmatism and censoriousness represent an appropriate attitude for someone contributing to an encyclopaedia. \n",

      "Since there is a section of the article that discusses Bethmann-Hollweg's ethnic heritage, I think it is clearly relevant that he was identified by the Associated Press and the New York Times in his own lifetime as a person of Jewish descent. The Associated Press and the New York Times are normally considered credible journalistic sources, so that the burden of proof rests on you to show that what was reported was false.

If you continue this destructive and harmful approach I will report you to an admin noticeboard.

The guidelines state that once notability has been established by independent sources (Harvard Pluralism Project, Star Tribune), primary sources (TCOR website, Dutch Cirkel website etc) can be used to provide information. Distracting readers from sourced evidence for notability is not really a concern; establishment of notability is the 'qualification' for inclusion in Wikipedia, once the topic is so qualified the article should contain all relevant information on the topic that can be cited to reliable sources.

      "\"\"Big names\"\" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is \"\"greater\"\" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .\n",

Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.\n",

      "The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was \"\"in use\"\" already, what does he consist of?\n",

      "Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.\n",

If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.\n",

The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want.

      "On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.\n",

At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance. But she has always cared more about genuine letters seeking to make connections.\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n",

      "(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna.

      "Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n",

      "A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n",

Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get).

      "The People on Rathlin were not Irish- they were the families of Sorley Boy McDonnell's followers. The Scottish clanchiefs had sent their families to Rathlin in the belief that they would be safe there. Drake had been hired to supervise the transport of John Norri's Troops to Rathlin, and then patrol the waters between Rathlin and the Mull of Kintyre to prevent the scots from sending reinforcements. John Norris had a force of 300 Foot and 80 Horse as well as siege-guns at his disposal; it seems extremely unlikely that he would have had to rely on Drake and the 25-strong crew of the \"\"Falcon\"\"- Drake's vessel at the time- to help Norris do his dirty-work for him.John Sugden's Biography of Drake contains a fair amount of info on the subject. 21:46\"\n",

It seems extremely unlikely that the plans ever called for such a comprehensive destruction of buildings from earlier expansion phases of the same plans. The historic urban planing maps also show no sign of an expansion of the airport beyond the current boundaries of its grounds.

      " No, I didn't liken you to a dog. That's just an expression that means things are going downhill, IOW civil fringe POV pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more, in spite of recent improvements in the way we're supposed to handle fringe beliefs. In this case allowing a one-sided POV driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. That was indeed uncivil and very impolite. Bang! Done! No discussion or request. I am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone I respected. That's all. Was what I said uncomfortable for you? Sure, but not incivil. You have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. You do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. When you're getting your way, you are very tough and civil. Somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments \"\"incivil\"\". You really do misuse that card by playing it too often. When you become perfect, then you can start pointing fingers. Keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil POV pusher. As I recall, you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. Your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to NPOV by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer, stonewall, and censure anything negative about chiropractic, no matter how well sourced, when we're actually supposed to follow the sources. That's just wrong. Since this is Tim's user page, it's probably best that this discussion not continue here (or even continue at all, since we never get anywhere). I just wanted to set the record straight that I certainly wasn't comparing you to a dog. I actually do have much higher opinions of you. I admire intelligence. I just wish it wasn't being used for such a nefarious and and non-NPOV purpose as \"\"to protect chiropractic's reputation\"\".

He found that most could be traced to free mixed-race families formed of descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia.[4] They migrated along with European American neighbors to frontier areas, where they found less restrictive racial conditions.

Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and \"\"just\"\" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.  \"\n",

      "Thanks, but it was not a simple 'disagreement about an article'. Please read this. Moriori deleted all the links I added instead of only the one problem link (which I believe was caused by the Parliament site being in flux at that point due to Carter's resignation, as cut and paste is usually straightforward). He made no attempt to simply fix the error. He made no attempt to contact me so I could fix the error. He then implied he did NOT delete everything, when he should have at least apologized for that error. He blamed me for everything, and in an insulting, condescending, arrogant way. Finally, he selectively edited our disagreement on his Talk page to make himself appear to be in the right. As a supposedly experienced Administrator (I note he started editing in 2003), all that is very wrong. I refuse to waste my time with a project which puts destructive people in leadership positions. If those are the sort of people you want to be in charge, then you need to look for contributors far different from me. I suggest you try the local playground.\n",

His most familiar way of doing this involves returning reds to the table that have already been potted. Another canny trick of his is adding more points than he should onto his score, whilst adding less than he should to opponents. He also has a tendency to say he hit a particular ball when it was obvious he did not. At times, Richard can also be mistaken for Nelson Mandela.\n",

The meet time at present is around 1220. RB often wears what RW describes as 'his lucky top' which features a dragon on the front. RW's lucky chain was removed after he lost nine frames in a row.\n",

The reasoning behind the one ice cube is that this is sufficient ice to cool the drink to an enjoyable temperature and yet not dilute the coke enough to affect its taste (noting that the room temperature of Rileys is at least a full three degrees above the standard 20-21 degrees and this hence means that should the generic four ice cubes be placed into the drink, they would melt at a particularly fast rate, diluting the cola even quicker).\n",

Describes the Chagi family as of Kshatriya caste (bahujakula) and gives the donor’s genealogy.\"\"  > from this inscription We derive Chagi family as belonging to Kshatriya caste - There is only Chagi royal family in entire telugu society, i.e Chagis of Kshatriya Raju's who ruled Krishna dist, later they ruled Peddapuram kingdom also. There are several inscriptions/books/evidences about Rajus/Rajulu as they have been in ruling since 5th century right from Eastern Chalukyas, after medieval period certainly ther kingdoms started diminishing except one or two.\n",

I agree with you on the point that most of Indian caste make puffery out of nothing, For this I would suggest to Wiki Founders to induldge the Genuine Historians of respective region like Andhra Historical Research Society to be involved and review the caste/community specific WP.

      "\"::::Weird. I deal with governmental agencies for a business, and it happens that we get notices when we fail to comply with something, and we fix it, and it is not serious. It would become so if we didn't respond. The report did not find any intentional failure to comply. As an example, one of the \"\"advertisements\"\" was an announcement by a governmental body. Such announcements might ordinarily be allowed. However, that governmental body also provides funding for the radio station. So was this an advertisement? The report considered it so. But it is easy to see how the station personnel may have failed to so consider it and thus to tag it. The report found no pattern of noncompliance. Just how serious this all was might be measured by the response to it in the radio community, which seems to be that the report was favorable to 8TOP. From the report, \"\"Two of the complaints also alleged that the service was failing to represent its community interest in line with its licence conditions. However, ACMA’s investigation found that the licensee was meeting the requirements of this licence condition. 8TOP’s licence was renewed by ACMA for a period of five years commencing on 2 August 2008.\"\" Essentially, the breaches were an insufficient system for soliciting and incorporating community input and two untagged announcements by sponsors.

If we know we can be sure of that we can be free of that \"\"pleasure\"\" then of course they should be taken off.

      "In the media (I do some media work) we often like to maintain that something was taken by our photographer or film crew — it sounds good to the viewer. Newspapers and TV stations don't explain to viewers and readers the concept of pooling where one agreed photographer takes images that then everyone uses. People would expect that if the Queen meets the Pope, that it would be the BBC who would record it, or if President Bush meets the Pope that it is CBS/NBC/ABC etc who were there, not the Vatican's own guy. I simply know how these things work because I work in the media and have had dealings with the Vatican Press Office — I am on their email list. In any case, as mantillas are worn exclusively in relation to meetings with popes, the only images available are going to be news agency images in the Vatican. Ordinary people aren't able to be there to photograph the head of state wearing one until the head of state goes walkabout with tourists (and their cameras) in St. Peter's Square, etc. So there is no alternative to those images. If there was, I'd use it immediately. (I spent an hour searching for alternative images. News agency images are only ever used by me as a last resort where we need to be able to show something and there simply is no other way of doing it. \\(caint) \"\n",

As for my own POV, if one can call it that, I don't have an in depth knowledge of the subject and I'm not Roman Catholic. I merely stumbled upon an article which seemed to have two editors with conflicting ideas (Jonathan Tweet and Lima) and as such I hope to format current information rather than introduce new information. I feel I am fairly unbiased, but I believe that the lead should deal more with the definition and explanation of the subject matter than going in depth about its history or disputation. As for going forward, I suggest the following. Once we receive GoldenMeadows' lead draft we'll have three drafts, from which we can choose one to refine and extend (probably incorporating elements from the other drafts as well).

      " It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.\n",
      "\n",
      " That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      " Let me explain what I mean with my \"\"intuitiveness\"\" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply \"\"antigravity\"\" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's \"\"beating\"\" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to \"\"beat\"\" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (\"\"then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right...\"\") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  \"\n",

The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    \n",

I just want the article to be factually correct so I am using the information provided in the Nihil obstat Imprimatur declared source by Prof. Alan Schreck which states on page 159 (author cites Lumen Gentium 22 and Catechism para 882 for the following): \"\"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered.\"\" That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church. The information about the college of bishops is discussed the section entitled Teaching Authority.

      "VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, \"\"someone you know\"\" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can \"\"talk\"\" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.

Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called \"\"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. \n",

      "Yes, that's probably the best way to view the development of that article. However, I can't go into that much detail myself because I certainly don't have the time to do that much research. That quote from Iliad is rather odd. Homer seems to be refering to Hesiod's earlier Theogony; but the details are different. The Perseus Digital Library (whose pages take some time to load; so for anybody reading this, be patient) translates Homer's quote just as you say (line 14 onwards), and has this to say for Theogony (line 720 onwards). I'm no classicist, but I'd be weary of that bit of text - it is certinly odd and probably should not be taken at face value so naïvely. As you say, everywhere else (as far as I know) he refers to the underworld as the \"\"domain of hades\"\". As for Erebus, the quotes from Iliad (under the heading: 3 from Homer, Iliad), at face value, seem to indicate that it is a place. But this is merely a misunderstanding of what Erebus is. Erebus is the gloom, the darkness of the underworld, the \"\"place of dark mists\"\" as you put it. Replace \"\"Erebus\"\" with \"\"darkness of the underworld\"\" or the like and the quotes make just as much sense as the assumption that Erebus is a physical location. However, I don't know of any source that explicitly states that it is a location in the underworld; so, again, where does that quote come from?  \"\n",

Also, the site points out frequently on the fact of \"\"quality over quantity\"\" of a side of the argument, and that not all sides of an argument have equal weight. For example, in the environmental situation of acceptance the only two viable arguments are that data overwhelmingly supports climate change and the contra is that correlation doesn't equal casuation, but the arguments that science is anti-environmental and that the environment is against God are poor arguments for and against, respectively.\n",

      " While others and I may agree with your opinion that \"\"Tetrapod-like features in fish are remarkable\"\", our opinions are ultimately irrelevant. Unsourced promotion of opinions, as well as the original synthesis (novel interpretation) of published material, violates Wikipedia's policies of neutrality, due-weight, and no original research. Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. \"\"Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics\"\") the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.  The facts themselves are certainly appropriate in each species' article, but combining them in a novel fashion to reach a conclusion(?) unsupported by sources is synthesis.  If you're concerned that interesting behavior or anatomy is not being highlighted, you might expand coverage in relevant sections of Fish locomotion or Diversity of fish. It's fine to say something like \"\"the Zob fish ventures onto land\"\", or even \"\"The Zob fish is a classic, textbook example of a tetrapod-like fish (Smith, 1980),\"\"  but it would be synthesis and non-neutral to say (or imply) \"\"The Zob fish interestingly resembles tetrapods because it ventures onto land\"\" without any citation.   \"\n",

The only ntl event I have not seen the full draw for  in '69 is Laver's win at Orlando over Rosewall. I saw your link to the warehouse talk and I am very pleased that someone has tracked down this extra match at the Dutch round robin. I use to think this was a 4 man rr, but found out it was 8 man with 2 groups of 4 earlier this year. There were some upsets at this event with Ralston  beating Rosewall on clay.  On the 1963 results I am slightly suspicious of Laver winning twice by the same score 6-0, 6-3 at MSG; once in the 6 man phase and once in the final play-off phase.\n",

Given that Firefly is proving to be a failure at the box office by the well accepted formula of Movie Cost > Box Office Take, I am suggesting we start formulating a way to add that to the article.

      "Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   \n",

      "“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.\"\"\n",

At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”    \n",

You were already thinking that the disciplinary function of a block might have been too much.  Well, isn't that the truth?  I still don't request a lift of the block.  If you don't like my attitude, can go ahead and make it an indefinite block.  There's really no difference and I have nothing to lose, with an Administration that does not take its own responsibilities seriously enough.  I have read the guidelines and it is rare that they are enforced for all parties in a editorial dispute.  No harm done, no feelings hurt.  Well now, who cares about Wikipedia anyways?    \"\n",

This view treats ITIS as a reference point, and nothing more.  If a person B's particular scheme differs from ITIS in a defined way it is 1 generation removed from ITIS.  A similar situation applies if C's scheme differs in defined way from ITIS.  However, if C defines his scheme with reference to B's then he is 2 generations removed from the reference point.

The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, \"\"many\"\" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (\"\"my way is the correct one\"\" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using \"\"many\"\" or \"\"most\"\" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that \"\"many\"\" do (I wouldn't even object to \"\"almost all\"\" or \"\"most\"\"), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!  \"\n",

      "The lead states \"\"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings\"\". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc). Ignorance must surely be bliss for these morons. Goodbye ye olde 'land of the free and the home of the brave'.\"\n",

However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the \"\"world that was\"\".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.\n",

      "Now, the English word \"\"formless\"\" in the NIV and the english words \"\"without form\"\" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as \"\"to lie waste\"\" or simply \"\"waste.\"\"  \n",

      "\n",
      "A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy \"\"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships\"\" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.\n",

Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. \n",

As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. \n",

Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source, while I would provide several references below. But, before that, your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation. \n",

      "Next, you keep quoting the sentence on \"\"not being Prophet, but illumined soul\"\". As per your own definition, \"\"Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations, believed to have come from God\"\". In this sense, since your own source says revelations, it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the \"\"non-Prophet\"\" aspect as reliable. Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words \"\"revelations\"\" and \"\"Prophets\"\". And further, again, even in your own source, when describing \"\"Guru\"\", the author quotes:\n",

It makes it very hard to follow the changes when you make a lot of small edits one after the other. Please try to abide by this in the future. While I will agree that this article needs more referencing, most of the things which you have added fact tags to are so well known as to be beyond dispute. Having said this I will be adding some appropriate references in the next day or so. However some things, e.g. Hermetic Qabbalah being a precursor to Wicca etc are not (as you say) bold statements but rather established fact. Also removing all the categories is not fixing 'overcategorization'. I'll agree that one or two of them were a bit spurious, but certainly not all of them.
