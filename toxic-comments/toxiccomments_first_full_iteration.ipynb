However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name \"\"JoeVialls\"\".  A bit like \"\"SlimVirgin\"\" eh.\n",

In the 1980's, I personally interviewed a former worker in his computer center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and heard about the highly questionable fund-raising methods employed.  That former worker told me that Humbard used \"\"scare tactics\"\" to get viewers, especially elderly viewers, to send in money.  The main ploy was to send out many mass mailings and claim that his program would go off the air unless the viewers sent in a lot of money.  The former computer center employee told me that Humbard told viewers in these mass mailings that \"\"the government\"\" was trying to shut him down.  Also, the former employee told me that the Canadian government was so concerned about the mailings and calls to elderly viewers in Canada that Humbard was banned from mailing any promotion materials to Canada. Humbard's computer system was state-of-the-art, as was his TV studio equipment.  An IBM engineer told me that Humbard had the newest and one of the best IBM mainframe computer systems in Ohio.  A former engineer at WJW TV 8 in Cleveland told me that Humbard had, at least for a few years, the most expensive and sophisticated television production equipment in the Cleveland area.  Again, according to that WJW engineer, Humbard's set-up was as good or better than any of the TV stations in Cleveland.  \n",

The revolving restaurant idea stirred a lot of controversy.  The concrete tower to support the restaurant was over 400 feet tall and the FAA was against the construction due to airline flight paths into Hopkins International airport.  Cuyahoga Falls is fairly close to the airport.  SEE: http://explorer.altopix.com/map/kdaocf/277/311/Rexs_Erection.htm   for a picture of the tower.\n",

The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the \"\"official view,\"\" as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.  Nonetheless, as long it's made clear to readers that the timeline is based on secondary sources, and that there is contention about the reliably of the secondary sources' references, then I suppose it would be a fair representation of the matter.\n",

It isn't the shock of finding the one anti-semite in all of 19th century Germany.  The shock all stems from Dummett building an unrealistic image of the guy.    \n",

The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.\n",

      "I just wanted to say that professional doctors in Brazil often use it along traditional Western health care (generally after, prescribing together with allopathic treatment, NEVER as medicine). There is an idea here of people of using it in the same way a vaccine could do good i.e. that thing I mentioned earlier with my experience, a really great quantity (in terms of homoeopathy, that is nearly nothing – that former doctor of mine explained the most common homoeopathy to my mother using the joke of the comparison to seawater) of dead ill-bearing beings together with herbal medicine. But I think no sane person would qualify it as cure anywhere, even in the limited demographics that homoeopathy, to say, can improve 5-20% of their immune system functioning (but all immune systems are different because every human is a universe, perhaps in most people something so light that is reason of mockery such as hpthy is likely worthless). Alternative medicine approach is not something to trust (much less alone) in case of death-threatening diseases – in the immune system example, homoeopathy would be used in light to mid allergies such as the source of my rhinitis, with a grain of salt in more serious conditions (together with traditional treatment – like what cured me from chronic sinusitis and otitis, and I attribute it more to the non-homoeopathic treatment), but I don't expect an effect at all with auto-immune conditions. If someone offers it as medicine, it is obviously quackery, but I think that the point of Mkweise is not how homoeopathy can kill by the ignorance of some users and/or shamelessness of quackers, but how it is said to not work in every situation, with nobody, and all scientific research adequately using methods of demonstrating it, what millions of people that are not necessarily ignorant (including 3 former doctors that saved my life that hadn't no profit with the so-called quackery) would disagree to.

Learn to admit your prejudice causes you to make mistakes or stop bitching about the \"\"level of the attack\"\" any knowledgeable observer would \"\"initiate\"\". Better still stick to things you actually are knowledgeable about. As for my references if you actually read them you'd see that Eurominority counts villages with full or partial use of the language and V-PRC gives percentages (being sample-based). Neither agree with Ethnologue and V-PRC comes above the SD estimate.   22:23, 29 April 2009 (UTC\"\n",

The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)\n",

If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  \n",

Based on bitter personal experience over many years, I've long given up on achieving \"\"consensus\"\" on something as controversial of monetary theory.  As Gregalton has pointed out on the debt-based monetary system talk page, it's not like \"\"quilting\"\".

Contentious enough for the argument to be concluded with an assassin's bullet (at least according to some monetary historians).

They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. \n",

People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.\n",
      "People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. \n",

      "To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.\n",
      "The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.\n",

However, I'd like to stress again that this is not about which moves should be carried out. I don't think the ArbCom would ever consider deciding on which articles should be renamed. Rather, this is about what steps the community can take to ensure that global decisions (naming conventions) arrived at by consensus are not blocked locally (when deciding what title to use for a specific article), or what to do when local decisions run counter to more encompassing principles.

If only the referenced sections were kept, that would still be substantially larger than the target size you advocate. In my mind, another AfD in a month or two would be a more straightforward way to handle it: either the list meets notability guidelines or it doesn't, but calling it a \"\"merge\"\" and deleting 90+% of the content is not the right way to get rid of the article.   \n",

Merging in the few decent references and a few of the examples is much better, as it allows for more control.   \n",

It seems to me, that \"\"Star City\"\" is the English name for this region - whether incorporated or not. Notice on other language Wikipedias, including the Russian Wikipedia, they don't have two articles on the area.. after all, the Russian names are the same. Maybe there's a dispute here on English Wikipedia because the English name (the one originally used by NASA) is different from the default transliteration (just like Korolev / Korolyov).  \n",

WP:RUS is not a key Policy or Guideline (maybe it's more like a WikiProject advice page, that achieved wide support in 2007); as such it should elaborate on the key policies, not change them. I think the \"\"dictionary\"\" requirement should be reworded, to allow for situations where the place name doesn't occur in a dictionary, but can still has a conventional English name.\n",

However, \"\"offenses against public decency\"\" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.\"\"\n",

If so, why was adultery illegal until 1975?? Even worse, why were 'children born from adultery' discriminated in inheritance up until 2001(!), when France was forced to change its law by the European Court of Human Rights ?? In regard to sexism, which is addressed here - France was one of the last Western countries to recognize the rights of women - vote for women only in 1944, women could not work without the consent of husband until 1965, leniency for 'crimes of passion' under the Napoleonic Code etc. Let's not even open this subject...

They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she \"\"thinks it is the most neutral one\"\". I am sorry but what some users \"\"think\"\" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border !

Turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the EU. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included.

      " 1.  God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.  \n",
      " 2.  Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown.  Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe.  A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions.  The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace.  The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself.  The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.\n",
      " 3.  God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe.  The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.\n",
      " 4.  God is supreme over the Universe.  It is God's creation and obeys God's rules.  Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.\n",
      " 5.  God has the ability to create and destroy energy.  Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.\n",
      " 6.  God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding.  God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.  \n",
      " 7.  God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.\n",
      " 8.  Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.\n",
      " 9.  God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.  \n",
      "10.  It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.\n",
      "11.  God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.\n",
      "12.  Love God.  Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life.  Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way.  Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people.  Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered.  The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).\n",
      "\n",
      "God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities.  God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many.  Love God.\n",

      "\":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.\n",
      "\n",
      " Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. \n",
      "\n",
      " To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. \n",
      "\n",
      " Saying that DLA has \"\" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ...\"\" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like \"\"in major financial centres\"\" or \"\"in major commercial centres\"\" or \"\"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres\"\" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.\n",
      "\n",
      " I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  \n",

That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your \"\"proof\"\" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own \"\"proof\"\" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154  \n",

All the points raised by myself and others concerning editor Eubulides with respect to his edits on the chiropractic article are indeed still playing out and hopefully other editors will see this trend and call him on it.\n",

I should have checked out the status before joining in, and it was only later that I realised that this wasn't the person that I actually know. It was clear after reading through the entire history that something was definitely not right. Geoff is quite rightly furious and is taking every step possible to find the protagonists. He has asked for his account to be suspended until further notice as he does not want this sort of thing to be repeated. I was very curious as he normally keeps his involvement in Templary quite private. There are however a few people out there who he has exposed for fraudulent activity and who will do nothing to get back at him. I am also very upset and can understand if editors do not want me to help out. Geoff's advice is to not get involved if these sort of problems can occur. But I am fairly good at reference checking, spelling and grammar if you require any help. I will also understand if you feel that my premature support without checking a real identity is disbarment to future assistance. Whichever way I wish you the best with the article on a subject that we are all like to study and promote. Geoff has emailed me to also pass on his wishes to all concerned and hopes you will understand his personal wish not to get involved. He is, though, another that wishes everyone the best of success in this article and is sorry that other people have been caught up in someone else's vicious attack on him.

It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.

How do you propose going about explaining it without making it a disproportionally large part of the article? Or is it so important it should be a large part?\n",

Its childish to allow admins to abuse the system and generally hold them to a lessor standard of editquette but then treat editors like second class citizens in the site. There are tons of childish things going on within this site, but my decision to not do the work because the community doesn't trust the work I do, after doing it for years, isn't particularly childish.

Look, you see IP from a certain range editing parlipro articles, you draw a certain conclusion, and you are pretty likely to be correct. The level of necessary coincidence for this to not be Fd would be astronomical. The particular interest in Sarsaparilla's edits, the mention of me, plus the first two IP fields, this is Fd. The vast majority of Fd IPs have not seen any edits before he started using them, they could probably be safely blocked ... but I'm not terribly exercised about it. I'd revert them if I thought them damaging. I hadn't looked at the other edits. I will. Anyway, thanks. And my apologies for any possible insult in what I wrote, but this whole affair has been about very selective attention. I'm seeing it happen with other editors. Once there is a pall over an editor, especially an active one, every move is scrutinized by anyone who ever had a conflict with him; one editor now, 25,000 edit level, is clearly being harassed, yet it looks like ArbComm will sanction him, not those who are harassing him.

      "Problems with the article\n",
      "Apparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as \"\"pop icons\"\" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are people whose work wasn't primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at the article, we see a section called \"\"Notable pop icons\"\" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer's poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by \"\"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.\"\"  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of \"\"pop icon\"\" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She's number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called \"\"MTV icons\"\", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1's target market, isn't exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 \"\"Icons of the Century\"\" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1's chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I've already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent \"\"every side of show business\"\", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as \"\"Icons of the Century\"\".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they're \"\"iconic\"\" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that isn't addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears' career has hit an air pocket, and there's no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it's premature to describe this relative newcomer as a \"\"pop icon\"\".\"\n",

However, considering how much traction Boswell's idea has gotten - virtually every work on Sergius and Bacchus that has been printed since discusses it (very often criticizing it) - it does need a brief, neutral mention here. I believe that the stable version of the article did that - it indicated what Boswell said regarding Sergius and Bacchus, and then noted specifically that other historians have criticized his methodology and interpretations.\n",

      " On April 21, 1659, after a morning prayer, Trubetskoy ordered an all-out assault on the fortress's fortifications. The city was shelled, a few incendiary bombs were dropped inside, and the huge army moved on to capture the city. At one point the troops of Trubetskoy even broke inside the city walls, but were thrown back by the fierce resistance of the Cossacks inside. After the fiasco of the initial assault, Trubetskoy abandoned his plans of a quick assault and proceeded to shell the city and to fill the moat with earth. The Cossacks stubbornly held on in spite of all the fire unleashed on the city: during the night the earth put to fill in the moat was used to strengthen the city walls, and the besieged even undertook several daring counterattacks on Trubetskoy's besieging army. These attacks forced Prince Trubetskoy to move his military camp 10 km away from the city and thereby split his forces between the main army at his HQ and the army besieging Konotop. It is estimated that in the siege alone the Trubetskoy forces suffered casualties up to 10,000 men.[4] Instead of a quick campaign the siege dragged on for 70 days and gave Vyhovsky the much-needed time to prepare for the battle with the Russian army. Please clean away this exaggerated and long tale about nothing. You must add information, that Trubetskoy negotiated with Gulyanitski and finally had to put siege. Gulyanitski just wanted to win time. You must give time schedule, dates of the events and clean away this heroisation of some coronel.\n",

      " The bloom of Moscow's cavalry, troops that happily accomplished campaigns of year 54 and 55 have perished in one day — the victors got only about 5000 captive. The unfortunate were led onto an open space and slaughtered like lambs — that was the agreement between the Crimean Khan and the hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks! Never again was the tsar of Moscow able to master an army that strong. In mourning clothes showed himself Alexei Mikhailovich to the people and the terror seized Moscow. The blow was so hard because it was unexpected, and it followed such illustrious successes! It was only recently that Dolgoruki brought to Moscow a captured Lithuanian hetman, only recently was everyone talking about successes of Khovansky — and now Trubetskoy, for whom everyone had hopes higher than for others, and who was \"\"a man devout and graceful, in military affairs skilled and a fright for a foe\"\" — has ruined such a huge army! After capture of so many towns, after capture of the Lithuanian capital the royal city trembled for its own security: in August by tsar's decree people of all ranks hurried to build fortifications around Moscow. Often the tsar and the boyars were present themselves during the construction; people from outlying areas, their families with meagre belongings filled Moscow, and a rumour spread that the tsar was leaving to beyond the Volga and Yaroslavl[1].

      "You are mistaken. The Johnson School is no different than the departments in the Arts College or the Engineering School. PhD students enroll in the Graduate School and pick a \"\"field,\"\" which roughly correspond to the various academic departments (e.g., Chemistry, Management, Mechanical Engineering.)  The Johnson School is not acredited to grant PhD degrees.  I still think that the article is POV because its history and alumni list give short-shrift to the Public Administration and Health Care Administration aspect of the school. For most of the school existence, these were perhaps its most distinguished programs.  The idea of reassigning notable alumni from the school where they graduated to a different school based on subsequent reorganizations is troubling.  I think we should just have  the list of notable alumni in the main Cornell Univrersity article and the List of Cornell University people.  In some cases, there is no modern equivalent to the program which granted a particular degree and in other cases we may not know the school.  Does it matter that Ed Marinaro was a Hotel School graduate when he is notable as a football player and actor and never entered the hotel industry?  Does it matter that Keith Olbermann went to the Ag School and is therefore presumptively less credible than Ann Coulter?  Breaking down notable alumni based on the current administrative location of their degree program is POV and SYN.   \"\n",

      "In many places in the article, we make statements which are based not on studies of AS, but rather of studies on people with various sorts of autism. While many researchers consider AS and HFA to be so similar that there is no point in even distinguishing between them, there is at least a significant minority who have championed the continuing existence of AS as a distinct diagnosis. If we treat studies on persons who were diagnosed with autistic disorder as if they had been diagnosed with AS, we implicitly bias the article in favor of the one viewpoint. So, even though I happen to believe that AS and HFA are the same in most important aspects, I intend to go through this article and weed out the bias. AS may not be very well researched, but there is not such a dearth of information that we are compelled to introduce large amounts of material on arguably different topics.\n",

In your wife's case, \"\"Sin Ho\"\" is the formal form of her first name. either the first or the second character, can be used as a pet name by the family, so those unfamiliar with their culture take it as a \"\"main\"\" first name. The family may also use some variations of this as a petname, like \"\"Sin Sin\"\", \"\"Ah Sin\"\", \"\"Siu Sin\"\", or otherwise \"\"Ah Ho\"\" etc. there are asians who consciously decide to use it as their main name, kinda akin to someone named William tells you to call them Bill, but in most circumstances, if you don't know that person well, it's considered disrespectful.  \"\n",

A quick run through my sources indicates that \"\"folk costume\"\", \"\"folk dress\"\", \"\"national dress\"\", \"\"ethnic costume\"\", \"\"traditonal dress\"\" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to \"\"folk costume\"\" or \"\"folk dress\"\" for the reasons cited above, but \"\"folk costume\"\" should not be a subset of \"\"national dress\"\" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).\n",

      "By the way, the use of narrow use \"\"costume\"\" to mean \"\"theatrical costume\"\" is about as common as the use of \"\"dress\"\" to mean \"\"a woman's garment with a skirt\"\".  Both \"\"costume\"\" and \"\"dress\"\" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  \"\"Clothing\"\" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing \"\"Medieval clothing\"\" vs. \"\"Medieval costume\"\" vs. \"\"Medieval dress\"\".  And \"\"folk clothing\"\" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, \"\"costume\"\" and \"\"dress\"\" are both preferred terms.\n",
      "\n",

      "COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.\n",
      "DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.\n",

ELECTRO (music), Electro (also known as Electro-Funk) is an electronic style of hip hop directly influenced by Kraftwerk, Jazz-Funk and Funk records (unlike earlier rap records that were closer to disco). Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer. Electro's sound is distinctively synthetic, instrumental, electronic and experimental. Additionally, the 808 drum machines pounding beats and pure sounds were heavily used in Hip Hop, Disco and Funk music. It was very popular in New York City during the early 1980s and late 1970s.\n",

      "\"\"in\"\" is acceptable but \"\"on\"\" is definitely the more common expression in this context.  Why? there is no why; it's just one of those perverse idioms of English.  We can be on form but later in decline; you might be instructed to do something \"\"when you are in receipt...\"\" but \"\"you should, on receipt, ...\"\".  The \"\"up\"\" and \"\"down\"\" conventions are even worse: we cut down trees, but then chop them up; after dinner we wash up, but to get rid of the suds we rinse down.  I could go on, but the short answer is I don't know why.  I know copper is not the only material, but that is the common expression, especially when disambiguating against fibre-optic. The reason here is obvious - it is by far the most common metal used for cables.  I don't really care if the article title gets changed, but this is what I think it should be.  \"\n",

      "The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.\n",
      "The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:\n",
      "1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.\n",
      "Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.\n",

      "Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.\n",

      "Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to \"\"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while\"\". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.\n",
      "It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.\n",
      "If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.\n",
      "I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.\n",

This particular subject is extraordinarily serious because it involves life and death medical decisions. Hence the need for an even higher standard of seeking sources of information with no history of hostility toward one view or another. Again, thanks for your assistance.\n",

      "Hi, thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on Bridget Taylor. A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a \"\"fan\"\" of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear\n",

Stop replacing the maps, sir, or we will continue to reverse your edits, which you take at liberty without a backing of facts or consensus.  There should be, like there is now, only 3 ways a state should be shown on the map: Southern (red), Not Southern (beige), and Southern with debate (striped red).  It is inaccurate to shade maps because there is no way that a gradation can be accurate in describing the various degrees of southern-ness.  For instance, I can tell you that the region of Maryland in which I work is more \"\"Southern\"\" than parts of Montgomery County (which is geographically to the south of me) - so, in no way, would the shaded map be accurate in this, and other cases.\n",

Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name.

You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals.

Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings.

For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.

I share your \"\"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,\"\" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that \"\"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates\"\" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up. But if what I wrote makes sense to you, there may be a real opportunity there at the moment for your NPOV-ish minority opinion to count for a lot. Regardless of whether you agree with my opinions above, I hope you consider contributing to the RfC there. I can't give a recap beyond what I already wrote above.   \"\n",

Manorama is one of the India's largest selling and most widely read news paper. There are more than 50 such newspapers in India. News reports from such dailies are not available in google eventhough it have millions of readership. But news reports from English dailies with 1000 or 2000 copies are available in google search.

I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.

      "\", I concur with White Guard that Lenin and his government committed many atrocities against the Russian people, and your attempt to 'whitewash' their reputation is somewhat historically inaccurate (please don't take this as a personal attack). As for the kulaks, you're perfectly correct that they never really existed as a class, and were invented by the Communists as an attempt to encourage 'class warfare' in the countryside - yet you choose to ignore the fact that it was Lenin, not Stalin, who began the campaign against the kulaks. It was, admittedly, Stalin who was responsible for the wholesale purging of kulaks as part of his collectivisation programme. Overall, I would say Stalin took Lenin's ideology to new heights of paranoia and mass murder - but the foundations of this ideology were all in the system that Lenin established. Stalin was worse than Lenin, but there wasn't a clean historical break between the two - they were part of the same authoritarian and brutal Communist tradition.  \n",

      "ANTI-SEMITISM.  Could I please have a reference for Nicholas' authorisation of the Kishinev massacre?  As far as I am aware this episode was the handiwork of Vyacheslav Plehve, minister of the interior and a notorious anti-semite.  The pogrom was condemned by the governor of Bessarabia and by the central government.  Sergius Witte, by far the Tsar's best minister, made his own feelings on the matter plain.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There were pogroms in Tsarist Russia, and anti-semitism was a long-established and poisonous tradition.  The point is that this cannot always be traced back to the Tsar: Russian state and government was far too complex for that.  Official anti-semitism was, moreover, of a confessional rather than a biological nature.  Under Alexander III the drive for assimiliation became ever greater, after the murder of his liberal-minded father, but it also affected Catholics, Lutherans and Muslims, as well as Jews.  Civil disabilities could always be lifted for converts to Orthodoxy, for those who were minded to take this path.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Nicholas was a conventional and unimaginitive man, but even he could detect the patently false.\n",
      "Although he was initially taken in by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (as was the London Times in 1919) he soon recognised them, according to Vladimir Burtsev, no friend of the Tsar, as dangerous political nonsense.  You may care to consult Solomon Grayzel, again no admirer of Tsarist Russia, who in his A History of the Jews says \"\"Even the Tsar had considered the forgery utterly improbable and unworthy of consideration.\"\" (Philadelphia, 1968, p. 613).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this whole debate arose because I questioned Lenin's credentials as a campaigner against anti-semitism on the basis of a single speech with no examples provided.  If we look at the actual record of Soviet Russia under Lenin a quite different picture emerges.  The age-old antisemitism of the Tsars showed little sign of going away; if anything, it got worse.  Red army units were amongst those responsible for pogroms in the Ukraine, to the obvious disquiet of Trotsky.  During the 1921 campaign against religion, specifically authorised by Lenin, the Jews were singled out as a special target; even Maxim Gorky accused the government of using anti-semitism for political purposes.  There were pogroms in Smolensk and other places.  When Jewish people tried to defend their synagogues, threatened with confiscation, troops broke in, shouting 'Death to the Yids' in the process.  The campaign of 1921 peaked in the mock trial of 'Judaism', carried out, for additionl emphasis, if any such was needed, in the very same courtroom as the Beiliss trial of 1913.  What price Lenin's support for the Jews?\n",
      "\n",
      "TERROR.  Yes, there was terror, extensive and brutal; but that of the Whites was more than matched by that of the Reds, and not just against counter-revolutionaries but peope who had been their allies and comrades in the political underground.  By 1921, well after the White threat had gone away, oppression and terror had become a fact of life in the 'worker's fatherland'.  It never went away. \n",

A multi-basis transistor would be a transistor with one Emitter, one Collector and more than one Basis. I cannot imagine how this should be made. It is thus more likely that people use e.g. two transistors in a specific way that would allow to compensate the noise. This is how the basic idea for the bipolar transistor has been discovered by Herbert Mataré in 1942 while he was working on a Duodiode that should allow to compensate the noise in a mixer for a 3 GHz Radar receiver.

Your statements of so-claimed or real consensus is bothering - there was a majority agreement for wording. You need to respect that while the discussion continues.

It doesn't help anything to go go back and forth on the article. Leave it alone - take a break.

The city itself gave birth to a number of Albanian nationalists, artists and politicians(most notorious being Enver Hoxha).

I know they're out there.  Once that is done, the superfluous material can be weeded out, and perhaps, just perhaps, one ends up with an article about parallel myths, which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with, which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth, son of God, resurrection, miraculous cures, etc.  Note carefully that I'm not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not.

When I post to an article about the city of Chicago, I do so as somebody who actually does live here, has done so for a good long time, and knows the place firsthand - something that the idiots who did the reverts can't legitimately claim for themselves.

      "The \"\"opinions\"\" given are on such subjects as what the lowest reported temperature in Chicago was, whether or not cheese customarily appears on an Italian Beef sandwich, and other things which, like these, aren't a matter of guesswork, but of simple observation. One of the additions I made to the article which somebody, I believe yourself, wiped out with a revert mentioned the \"\"arctic express\"\" winter of 1981-82. When one takes the already silly concept of NPOV, and exaggerates it to the point at which one wipes out mentions of actual historical events which one just doesn't happen to have been will informed enough about the subject to havew heard of, one has reached a level of lunacy unusual even by the standards of the Internet and postmodernism.

If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation.

      "\n",
      "Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. \n",
      "\n",
      "The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of \"\"wet affairs,\"\" with \"\"wet\"\" meaning \"\"bloody.\"\" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. \"\"Your hands are blood-stained too,\"\" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.\n",

Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

      "I think I can help with some explanation here, as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry, quantum physics, and engineering. The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. The viewer is stationary, yes, but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving, and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties.  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches, and rise as it recedes from, a viewer.  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can, in precise circumstances, temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated, and you can see the article slow light for more information. You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite, but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not 'infinite' infinite inertia. The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain, whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial, a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered, or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. At the point that these conditions end, the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic 'cage' and re-emmited. I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant \"\n",

      "I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a \"\"single\"\", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.   \"\n",

Ahmadinejad consistently refers to \"\"the Zionists\"\" and NOT \"\"Israel\"\".  Also, phrases like \"\"Israel should be WIPED OFF THE MAP\"\" are inventions of Zionist-controlled Western media.  Ahmadinejad never said that phrase, and what he was referring to, which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to \"\"[the usurping regime of Israel] should be eliminated from the page of the world\"\"  one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be \"\"wiped off the map\"\", but that is not what Khomeni had originally said.  Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media (in my opinion, Zionist-controlled Western media) suddenly blew it way out of proportion, for obvious reasons.

I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it.

The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat \"\"chatty\"\" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.\n",

      "\n",
      "Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] \n",

      "Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to \"\"climb soapboxes\"\" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. \n",

      "Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. \n",
      "Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small \"\"garage\"\" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. \n",

The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.\n",

If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.\n",

      "This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions.

So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.\n",

True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to.

If you look at what is supposed to be my userpage (I say supposed because I have a Blackberry which seems to share an IP with probably 28 million other people), you will see a whole catalogue of entries I am supposed to have edited in a negative fashion to the extent that I was banned from making further edits. The problem is that I only edited 2 entries - for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War. I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out.

It was during a live performance of I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's on youtube I think but for me it doesnt load all the way and appears to.\n",

      "The distinction I would draw is whether the content is published and accepted.  Wikipedia:No original research#What_is_excluded.3F gives a list of seven criteria for determining whether or not something is original research ... but really what it boils down to is whether or not you can find other secondary sources making the same claim.  I had never heard of this tomb before this evening so obviously I don't know enough about it to say what is and is not accepted science in this respect.  ;)  From what you are saying, it sounds like there are two questions - (1) is it appropriate to discuss the symbolism findings in the article and (2) if so, is it appropriate to cite your work.  In the case of the former, it depends on whether or not this has become an accepted finding.  Is it still a theory or has it gained acceptance?  Have other authors picked up on it and do they cite it as accepted truth or as a new theory?  The primary reason for the original research policy is that there are constantly new theories coming out about everything - Jimbo (the founder of Wikipedia) originally mentioned physics, but I think it applies to any field.  Some theories are good for a term paper or thesis and never see the light of day again.  Others become accepted truth over time.  Wikipedia is not the place for giving a sounding board to new ideas and theories - we wait until they are accepted.  The second question is whether, if this content is to be included, it would be appropriate to cite your book.  I believe, as I said before, that you (personally) should not add it, but should let someone else do it - that's just basic journalistic integrity - we as individual editors don't promote our own stuff.  Blogs are almost never considered appropriate ... so I really don't think having a link to your blog would be a good idea.  Sources on Wikipedia should be peer-reviewed journals, newspapers, etc, where more than one person is responsible for the content.  Blogs are generally a bad thing.  I hope all this helps ... I know I've rambled a bit. (As a quick side note, please sign messages on talk pages using four tildes - ~~~~ - it will automatically turn into a time/date stamp with your name ... it makes conversations easier to follow.)\n",

I would say you wouldn't have to put those in, but the episode list has a section for the production code, so normally most shows,  iCarly, How to Rock , Jessie, etc. if it's an hour long episode for season one the code will be 111-112 because it counts as two and since the wikipedia asks for a production code, I think it's needed. Since itunes does not show production code order rather just list the episodes as their shown on TV, that do not include that. This is why I strongly feel that shows like Victorious (episode\"\"Freak the Freak Out\"\") and others should be listed as two and not one. It was an hour long episode after all, and if you go back and check how many episodes Nickelodeon ordered for the first season of Victorious it says 20, which was also confirmed by the shows creator Dan Schneider. I strongly disagree that it should say 19 (along with other shows that have been edited)\"\n",

      "I agree with Kamosuke on some points, however I still prefer Sir Edgar's version over Kamosuke's although not perfect.  I request Sir Edgar's version to be modified to mention Western influence before and under the sakoku policy.\n",
      "Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.\n",

      " I see a bit of confusion here, and it seems to be caused by semantics.  People can argue forever over whether the transistor is \"\"voltage controlled\"\" or \"\"current controlled.\"\"  And each side means something different by that.  And each side is trying to win an argument, not trying to clarify matters.  (They already know the truth.  In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)\n",
      "\n",
      " Instead, what if we ask a different question:  how do transistors work?\n",
      "\n",
      " In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept:  when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter.  There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow.   Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current!  The hfe parameter is no illusion.  Base current obviously does control emitter current.  How?  It's because any change in Ib absolutely requires a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer.   Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer.  Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter.  They just can't do it directly.\n",
      "\n",
      " So is a transistor controlled by current?  Yes, if by \"\"controlled,\"\" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current.  Is it \"\"controlled\"\" by voltage?  Yes, if by \"\"controlled\"\" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe.  And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the \"\"right answer.\"\"  They'll almost come to blows over the One True Path to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.  After all, young students could be misled from the One True Path!  Think of the children!  )\n",

Instead, it's easier to become a devout \"\"Current Believer\"\" at the start.  But then the mental grip of that meme is shattered by encountering the competition.  So you become an outspoken \"\"Voltage Worshipper.\"\"  With luck you'll eventually be immunized against both, yet accept both.  The \"\"Transistor Zen\"\" practitioner is free to view BJTs from both viewpoints, switching back and forth as needed, while seeing the duality as an illusion and rejecting the notion that a single best answer can exist.    \"\n",

I had a quick look round after you 'facted' London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and was quickly able to verify most of them from one source.

They were dropped by Sire Records that year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee Ramone's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies.

For example, contrary to what the table suggests, both س and ص are usually represented by 's'; the distinction by using a capital 'S' for ص looks very neat, but I have never seen it in use. I would therefore suggest to provide more realistic examples, such as: (Lebanese) kif/keef sa7tak, chou/shu 3am ta3mil? weyn baddak nitghada? etc. Maybe it should also be noted that - in parallel with Arabic writing - there is a tendency to omit vowels.79.219.118.88\n",

      "The name used is for the languages spoken within Iran, which is the South Azeri dialect written in the modified Arabic alphabet.  Thus, it is inconsequential how the language/alphabet of another country uses such a term.  For example, if the term Iran was used different in say the Persian of Afghanistan, it is inconsequential for an article on Iran.  In Iran no one writes: \"\"Güney\"\" with such an alphabet in the Azeri publications there (say newspapers).  Because first of all, they use the modified Arabic alphabet and second, it is politically charged.  Second, the same region (a good portion of it like all of Western Azerbaijan) is called by Kurdish nationalists as \"\"Eastern Kurdistan\"\".  For example, in the Northern Federal region of Kurdish Iraq, they use East Kurdistan for all of West Azerbaijan with their own alphabet.  However, this does not mean we put \"\"Eastern Kurdistan\"\" in say the article West Azerbaijan for Kurdish language or here.   Thus what matters is mainstream and official publications within Iranian Azerbaijan, and even the term \"\"Güney\"\" is not used that much as the word \"\"Jonub\"\" is used for \"\"South\"\" more often then \"\"Güney\"\".

I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  \n",

You only have one weapon, your suit, which is equipped wit ha hand shot, and a list of combo moves. Your main goal in each level is to get to a certain area, and/or destroy a certain objective.

The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the \"\"Personal life\"\" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon).

So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank. Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

An illegal alien who entered the United States without inspection, for example, would be strictly defined as an immigrant under the INA but is not a permanent resident alien. Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States.

You find considerable scaling mistakes and conscious choices at articulated the bones that betray Paul's biases to making them as skinny as possible, like the scapular blade being too high in the torso or the concave gastralia that Hutchinson et al. already mentioned as inaccurate in their comments. Using a more accurate reconstruction and following a similar method to Greg Paul, Scott Hartman has estimated the mass of Sue at 8.4 metric tonnes.

If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.\n",

Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta.

A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor \"\"A\"\" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.\n",

Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. \n",

Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it.

It did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia.   Don't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.  You might find it useful to read Your First Article for some good advice about starting to create articles on Wikipedia.  Two important rules of thumb are: Avoid  writing about yourself, your business, your family and friends, or your web page, and avoid writing about anything that hasn't been written about in reliable sources like books, newspapers, and magazines.  Anyway, don't be discouraged.  I've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.  If I've made a mistake, and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria, then please let me know my leaving me a message and links to at least three newspaper articles, magazine articles, or books that have been written about the subject, and I'll be glad to undelete it, and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake.  - (talk · contribs) \"\n",

As I have mentioned here and elsewhere, Petrarchan47 has been engaging in this behavior - going on the Talk pages of users he/she believes are sympathetic, and making these kinds of unfounded accusations against me and other editors, for quite some time, and I have had it with being bad-mouthed.   That is one issue  the other one is the more garden-variety of canvassing about specific article content.  I am not even editing or watching the MaM article, as I already was fed up with Viriditas' behavior there.  In any case, informing these users that their behavior is outside guidelines is not intimidation - it is fair warning.  The next time the behavior happens - if it happens again - I am indeed going to start an ANI.  I really have had it.  There are appropriate ways to deal with perceived COI and going around on user Talk pages and article Talk pages and making these accusations is not among those ways.  I tell you - I feel persecuted.   That matters too.   Paid editing is an issue but that doesn't mean that everyone who disagrees with you is a paid editor.  I could start (and I am not!!) going around and writing everywhere that P is an employee or paid PR person for Greenpeace, right?  He/she must be because of the positions that P takes in these articles about environmental issues!  But I am NOT going there.  And neither should P.  Otherwise it is wild McCarthyism - slapping people who disagree with you with a label so you can dismiss them.  Just the facts indeed!  No more of this personal attack based on 100% speculation.\n",

Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.\n",
      "What makes it a Good Story?\n",
      "The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.\n",

It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.\n",

      "\":Both in current numbers (24%) and in historical context, Roman Catholics are a minority religion in America. Even among Christian \"\"believers\"\", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the \"\"other\"\". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all \"\"conservative\"\" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005\n",

My feeling is there is no reason to go overboard questioning the basis of these claims, since it is simply possible to write the entry making clear that they are claims. It is not the place of this talk page to conduct some kind of forensic investigation into the validity or otherwise of Mr Langan's IQ (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just making a point). I agree with you that at this high end of the scale the measurement of IQ probably becomes quite inexact, but after all that is not Mr Langan's fault. I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be. I note for the record that this obviously does not mean Mr Langan's CTMU theory is correct, but neither does questioning Mr Langan's IQ undermine his CTMU.\n",

For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).\n",

      "Byrgenwulf complains that \"\"we chaps\"\" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. \n",

      "This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert.

Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.\n",
      "First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.\n",

If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.\n",

However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under \"\"Animation villains\"\", as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as \"\"Villain groups\"\".  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.

I hae edited pages because the original authors have put in factual errors or I have added things and sourced them. I edited the PIRA article, because Jdorney continues to revert it back to the un-factual article he orginally wrote. If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.\n",

If people disagree with my edits, they can tell me in a grown-up professional way, or they can re-edit the article. I am more then willing to work with people on Wikipedia, but to be blocked for bogus reasons is a disgrace. I have obeyed the rules of Wikipedia, if I am doing something wrong, send me a message, and I will adress that. But I will not stop contributing to articles, that is the whole point of Wikipedia, if it bothers some editors like SWATJeaster and Jdorney...well, that's too bad, they need to get over themselves, and either fact check their articles, or make it so nobody can change them.

An RfC from one article is not sufficient justification for enacting similar changes to another article, even if both articles cover similar topics.

Other than that, unless there is good evidence that this was a racially motivated death (is there any evidence of such whatsoever?), it's simply not relevant. I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede.

As you, yourself, told Jehochman,  it is highly questionable' behavior to edit an article to which one has such a significant dispute resolution COI.  I'd say a key policy by which desysoppings are judged by adminship is a \"\"No Go\"\" area for someone who just finished a recall process and has an RFAR pending for things related to adminship and recall.\n",

Currently, the amount of hydroxy gas (H H O) produced from water is very much relative to the set up of the system, the frequency used etc.  Various voltages, amperages and frequencies have been used to various degrees of effectiveness.  The cost is, of course, relative to the source of electricity used.  There are many people who claim to be getting extremely high (even over unity) returns by using the resonant frequency of water.  Regardless of whether these claims are true, this method should be given more than a cursory footnote, as it IS very simple.  \n",
