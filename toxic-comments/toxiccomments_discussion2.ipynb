As you had known, I sat beside Arturo D. Brion's wife, my seat and classmate Antonietta from 1978-1982, Ateneo Law School. And I accepted God's will for me as closed Catholic amid my strong faith when I predicted the Supreme Court appointment of Brion as the Benjamin of the Court, way back on 2003 when I can't forget the pansit canton the spouses served me in Pandacan, Manila, so memorable. And Arturo D. Brion, signed the final Court resolution which put the final nail to my judicial career's coffin on June 3, 2008, exactly 25 years from June 3, 1983, when LUIS, Armand and Angel, holy angels of God first faced destiny and me-my brother Robert. Judge and Justice Brion are our icon. I had continuously prayed Psalm 109 as you noted in your email to me. Peace of Christ!

The matter of relevance is an entirely separate issue, however.  It is not a 'conspiracy theory' but clearly a reaction to the increasing awareness of the dangers of Propecia.  They shut down both of their finasteride websites within months of updating the warning labels to include information that finasteride can cause irreversible side effects.  However, stating that the website was shut down and replaced with a link to FDA medwatch does not contain any editorial opinion and is simply fact.  I now turn to other Wikipedia members for additional opinions since JFDWolff has been unreasonably disagreeable in my experiences with him in the past and a single opinion is not sufficient to remove edits.

      "There is now a theory postulated by Dr. Gerald E. Aardsma and Dr. Emmanuel Anati that states the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites occurred prior to the late Bronze Age as had been originally theorized. Doctors Aardsma and Anati say they have found evidence to support Joshua’s conquest occurring in the early Bronze Age at around 2200-2500 B.C. They state that both a settlement bearing topographical similarity to the biblical city of “Ai” and the city of Jericho were destroyed in this time frame and that both sites had defensive walls at this time. In addition, it was found the city of “Ai” was burned to the ground at this time, which fits the events in the Book of Joshua. Furthermore, it has been found that at this time the previous inhabitants of the areas around these cities gave way to a more nomadic people with different types of pottery than the original inhabitants and which developed into a pastoral society dominated by small villages. All of this would more accurately reflect what was recorded in the Biblical accounts of Joshua’s invasion, but it also conflicts with some of the Bible’s Old Testament chronology.

As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, \"\"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?\"\" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      " The beginning could say: \"\"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.\n",
      "\n",
      " The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.\n",
      "\n",
      " In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.\"\"\n",

      "Hi Tavix. How are you doing? I think I need to ask you for your help, if you don't mind helping a newbie, since i can see that you've had experience in editing articles, and seem to be an authority on article qualification. Again, I'm new to wikipedia, and I have one purpose here, to have a page for the hockey league I belong to. I have read countless help articles, linking to other help articles, linking to more help articles.  I've read 'notibility', 'articles for deletion', 'deletion policy guidlines', in my efforts to save my page from the few people who seem to want the page gone forever. These people have not giving any advice, just citing everything that's wrong with the page, and nothing that is right.  Can I change your mind on windsor floor hockey league, and, your proposing on deleting it?  I would do whatever possible to comply with the rules of wikipedia and have read quite alot in the guidelines about why the page SHOULD be included. (so many, i donno where to begin -social & recreational clubs have a place on wiki -  -Included in the article is a physical address of where the games take place, some article i read said that stands for something- there's alot of reasons why it SHOULD exist on wikipedia and about two or three small debatable issues about lack of notibility). I included all the league's website and pages, and it's not like anyone is debating the truthfulness of the article, but they do insist on citing the page for 1. notability, 2. More independant sources.   Where i have done the best i possibly can, I included all the links EVER available,   And having said that, ask any of the 80+ families that are effected by this league, in a town, during a time, where 10% of it's population has been laid off indefinitely.   This league is notable to me, and to others, isn't that enough for you?\n",

      "Can you answer me this: how is this league not notable to the people and families who CARE about it, notibility is in the eye of the beholder.

Even dictionaries don't include all words immediatly on use. Is the word google a verb? Is it in a dictionary? Will it be in the future?

The recent APA report says that what they say they think they are doing is not what is happening.  They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

The aforementioned sub-pages are now all linked in the introductory text of this article - links like dablinks were tried, but eventually edited out, as they were thought to cause too much clutter at the top of the article, since there IS a template at the bottom (in addition to the links to sub-pages in the text, as mentioned). At any rate, this article has almost become a Portal to H2G2 in all forms, in all but name, and saying that this article is about just the novel is simply incorrect.\"\" The other pages are: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film).

Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).\n",

      "Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\n",

      "Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding \"\"sea level\"\" or \"\"liftoff\"\" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:\n",
      "\n",
      " Sea level liftoff thrust\n",

      " Vacuum peak thrust\n",
      " Vacuum average thrust\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).\n",
      "\n",
      "When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.\n",

This disruption of the Royal Navy plans, along with the damage inflicted upon the escorting units, made the cargo ships an easy prey for the German and Italian torpedo-bombers the morning after the battle. \n",
      "The only cargo ship to make Malta undamaged by the bombs was the Talabot, largely overdue from the original timetable. All the other were hit in some degree by axis aircraft BEFORE reaching the harbour (not just Clan Campbell, which means that the Royal Navy was still responsible for the steamers fate), further hampering the escorts effort to disembark the supplies in time. \n",
      "So, despite the remarkable skills of the British units to save the merchantment from an attacking Battleship, the naval engagement should be considered a marginal victory to the Italians. \n",

      "Hypertension\n",
      " \n",
      "Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the \"\"top\"\" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the \"\"bottom\"\" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.\n",

      " \n",
      "Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.\n",
      "Bone Loss\n",
      "Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual Dysfunction\n",
      "Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.\n",
      "Pregnancy and Preeclampsia\n",
      "Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.\n",
      "This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.\n",
      "Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.\n",
      "Uterine Fibroids\n",
      "High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outlook for Children with Hypertension\n",
      "Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor\n",

Given this and Kuja's already substantial section on the list of FFIX's characters, as well as the fact that describing IX's story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway (sales figures aside, he is the central conflict of the game, really; the same can't really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X; in order for them to get proper coverage, they'd have to get their own articles), it seems to me like him having his own article's kind of unnecessary. Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the game's story, and any discussion of the game's story is going to largely be a discussion of him, so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles (Final Fantasy IX, List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja).\n",

Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).

Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:\n",

      "The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.\n",
      " \n",
      "One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with \"\"His works include...\"\") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.\n",
      " \n",
      "Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.\n",
      " \n",
      "A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.\n",

I'm not the least bit sure that the USAF's \"\"Air Force Historical Studies Office\"\", which is \"\"headquartered at the Pentagon\"\", meets the criteria for WP:NPOV. Indeed, I suggest that it is very appropriate to use caution regarding any weight attributed to the USAF's analysis of actions performed by the USAF (see WP:Conflict of Interest). Especially as it regards to such controversial operations, (the USAF investigating the actions of the USAF are akin to the police investigating the conduct of police officers - heavy bias is inevitable). Further more, it may be argued that such a source violates WP:Primary Source.\n",
      "Batvette, the \"\"air force historical society[sic] analysis of Dresden firebombing that you have provided place's some emphasis on the military value of Dresden as a target for strategic bombing. It refers to Dresden's value as a transport and communications hub, (see para II). It also refers to \"\"[s]pecific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot\"\", (see para II.10). Perversely, one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden \"\"was protected by antiaircraft defenses, antiaircraft guns and searchlights\"\", (see para 11). I'm not at all sure what to make of that bizarre reference.\n",

      "The historian Alexander McKee has cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in 1953 USAAF report and point out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of town and not in fact targeted during the raid.McKee (1983), p. 61,62 The 'hutted camps' mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were provided for refugees. It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River.McKee (1982), pp.62,63. Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that: \"\"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped\"\"McKee (1983), p.61. McKee further asserts, \"\"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure\"\"McKee (1983), p.63.\n",

R. Allen said, \"\"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence\"\"McKee (1983), p. 315.

      "Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including \"\"Jewish\"\" at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to \"\"single out\"\" Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' \"\"early anouncements\"\",  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his \"\"extraordinarily reliable Agent D\"\" report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary \"\"contributors\"\" to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an \"\"interest\"\" on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  \"\n",

I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would.

Anyhow, to do my part, I replaced a section in the history part. I believe it gives a succinct account of the mandolin's origin. The facts- names, places and years- are footnoted. Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments. When that is done, there will be no need to add to the mandolin's definition to try to expain why it is different from these similiar instruments.

I don't recommend that she be unblocked any time soon (I really don't see any evidence that she has ever substantially contributed to the encyclopedia, and I have no reason to believe that she would start doing so were we to unblock her), but I may have been mistaken in identifying her with the program vandals she shared an open proxy with.

I explained (in this section) that I would be at first editing out (using < !  /  >) and then deleting any comments made subsequent to the blocking of me by gnangarra/garra.

I do not welcome further comments about it (since I am restricted from replying to them by Shell and the current blocking administrator's block), and, therefore, I will delete them.  To continue to place them here, on my talk page, is, in my view, based on what Shell has advised me about my own comments, inappropriate.\n",
      "(cont.) Re: views about the current block by Gnangarra/garra:  people can contact the blocking administrator Gnangarra/garra directly to comment on the block one way or the other.  But one does need to keep in mind that it is a violation of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette to lobby for blocks of other users who are not engaging in any currently blockable behavior (as I am not).\n",

Please see the end of the now-archived closed report via WP:ANI.  Thanks again.    \n",
      "My current talk page is also not for debating Gnangarra/garra's (in my view and that of Shell) unfounded block of me (my unblock request explains my view of it); if you have your own views about the block, please communicate them on Gnangarra/garra's talk page or on the talk page of the last declining administrator , not on my talk page, but please be mindful of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette, or you yourselves may find yourselves blocked (!).  Lobbying for (or perhaps even against) blocks of me on my talk page (or elsewhere) is, in my view, uncivil and a violation of Wikipedia:Etiquette, and I will delete further such discussions from my current talk page.  I am not currently editing Wikipedia because I am blocked from doing so.  I don't want also to become blocked from my own talk page.  If people make personal comments about me as a contributor, I will consider them potential violations of WP:CIVIL, and I will remove them, as per the policies already linked in my \"\"N.B.\"\" section; please read it.

      "Posted on 29 August, 2006\n",
      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",

      "\n",
      " Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should \"\"step back from this type of edit\"\" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.\n",
      " 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.\n",
      " Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!\n",
      " Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.\n",
      " Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a \"\"long term campaign of harassment\"\" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.\n",
      " To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an \"\"inappropriate\"\" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin\n",

      "Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. \n",
      "\n",
      "The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of \"\"wet affairs,\"\" with \"\"wet\"\" meaning \"\"bloody.\"\" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. \"\"Your hands are blood-stained too,\"\" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.\n",

With other cables I've seen, the MALE end is the one where there is a center pin or set of pins plugging into a jack where there's a receiving hole in the center, whether or not there's also a female-like sheathe of some kind around the connector pins. For examples: coaxial cables (F, RCA, etc.), DIN cables (S-video, some older rounded computer cable plugs, etc.), \"\"D\"\" plugs, and DVI. Of course there would be others, too. Okay, so the one with the pins has been male, while the one that the pins plug into is female, even if the one with the holes fits into an outer casing that the one with the pins is in.\n",

      "Well, that's been true up until HDMI came out, apparently. Look at HDMI and what the industry is calling its \"\"female\"\" and \"\"male\"\" ends. They're calling the end with the pin row the female end, and the end with the slot that the row of pins plugs into the \"\"male\"\" end (and keep in mind that the end with the bar of pins is also the end with a female-like casing around it, just as I pointed out above, yet those above like that are still MALE; yes, the slotted end of HDMI sort-of plugs into the sheathed-like end, but then so do several of those others I mentioned above which were always called FEmale, because what really counts has been the PINS, not the edges. So why isn't HDMI's PIN end the one called MALE like the others?\n",

      "\"\"Democrat Party\"\" is a term used in the United States instead of \"\"Democratic Party\"\" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer \"\"they are the only true adherents of democracy.\"\"[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term \"\"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.\"\"[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only \"\"deeply committed\"\" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is \"\"trivial\"\".[2][3] [4]\n",
      "\n",
      "History of usage\n",
      "The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, \"\"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.\"\"[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled \"\"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'\"\"[7]\n",

      "P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense. While I don't know for a fact that you took offense at all, I'm troubled by the correspondence between our discussion and your departure from the project.

Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.

I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there.

I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles \"\"I wrote\"\" or refers to \"\"my articles\"\" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in \"\"missing links\"\" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any \"\"push back\"\" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while.

It confuses the term mesirat nefesh citing both a literal meaning (dieing for the faith) and a figurative one (trying really hard).

      "Interestingly, Ray Franz writes (pg 385-386) about several letters he sent to his uncle after being disfellowshipped. He says he expected no reply and received none. He includes an extract from a letter he sent to him in 1988 as Fred Franz neared death. He says he was not surprised he received no reply, but was sad, nonetheless. I'm intrigued, Fazil, about your comment, \"\"Later on his vitriolic sentiments/bias in his book suggests his dis-fellow-shipping was justified again and proves he is dishonest.\"\" Ray Franz was certainly critical of the WTS in his book, although \"\"vitriol\"\" seems too harsh a word. The overall tone of the book is concern and sadness, but if you have read the book you are free to make your own judgment. But what dishonesty are you referring to, and what is it in his book that \"\"proves\"\" he was dishonest? Willietell makes a claim based on local gossip that Franz lied about why he disassociated — though all the evidence points to Franz being right and Willietell being wrong — but I know of no other allegations that Franz was dishonest. Throughout his time in, and then out, of the organization, he was revered as a man of strong principle .... which, of course was the reason he decided he could no longer remain on the Governing Body or in the religion.   \"\n",

      "I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:\n",
      "\n",
      " Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid \"\"academic phrasing\"\" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example \"\"social cost\"\" or \"\"social production\"\".\n",
      " Speaking of \"\"social production\"\" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by \"\"proportions of social production\"\" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between \"\"economic worth\"\" and \"\"social worth\"\" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between \"\"social product\"\" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.\n",
      " \"\"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.\"\" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really \"\"inherently\"\" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern \"\"working class people\"\". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of \"\"economic worth\"\" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.\n",
      " Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question \"\"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?\"\" is not obviously or directly related to the question \"\"what was the social power of capital in 1840?\"\".\n",
      " Some ideas for expansion: \"\"Theoretical problems\"\" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). \"\"Wage price series\"\" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a \"\"real price\"\" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide \"\"snapshot\"\" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.\n",

      "Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time \"\"mother tongue\"\" and \"\"most frequently used language\"\" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the \"\"mother tongue\"\" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about \"\"Orthodox Chams\"\"). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.\n",

Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.\"\n",

      "How about just wait until the game gets released?  I don't think it's fair to call the game simply a port when it is adding on two new characters.  Not to mention new content.  Fully voice dialogue, etc.  There's no arguing that this is basically a remake of So2 but it's also adding new features.  Therefore, I don't think it's a port but it's not the same game either.  It's somewhere in between.  It's a remake with add ons.  If Yamagishi wants the remakes to feel like two totally different games, then why don't we treat them as such until we find out otherwise.  This is even MORE TRUE for First Departure.  How on earth can First Departure be a direct port of Star Ocean when it has the Star Ocean 2 battle engine?  According to these entries and some other news I've read, it seems that both of the remakes have a fair amount of new things.  Being a tri-ace fan since 1998, I'd advise you probably just wait.  This isn't just like comparing Valkyrie Profile and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth.  This is much different.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always \"\"100% correct and 100% according to policy\"\" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)\n",
      "\n",
      "I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), \n",
      "\n",
      "Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105\n",

      "Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I have to disagree about your disambiguity-argument. You say \"\"Germany\"\" can refer to either \"\"West Germany\"\" or \"\"East Germany\"\". This is - as I already stated - simply not correct, since there never was a country named \"\"West Germany\"\" and there never was a country named \"\"East Germany\"\", they were called those names in foreign media for simplicity reasons, as the \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" was part of the western capitalist world or first world, while the \"\"Peoples Republic of Germany\"\" was part of Eastern bloc, or second world. Still this is not the correct term for the country, and is therefore no phrasing for an encyclopaedia. It is colloquial language that saves time, but still this doesn't make it the correct term. I do not make up names or use other possibly derogatory terms for other countries, and therefore would prefer, if wikipaedia articles are kept in a neutral tone too. So if there is really confusion to avoid, then the only correct way to do so, is to use the complete names of the country, and not some popular slang. To be honest, i didn't think there would be a confusion, and someone might think this final was between the Peoples Republic of Germany and England, and not between the Federal Republic of Germany and England (since the Peoples Republic of Germany only participated in one World Cup anyways). But that's probably me knowing already a lot about this topic and forgetting about people that know little about World Cup history, so i might be wrong. But if others do think the distinction is necessary, then please distinguish the teams with the real names of the country and not colloquial language. Finally i want to point out, that the link to Germany National Footbal Team leads to an article that already explains, that there were temporary governing football associations other than the DFB, so if there really is a confusion which German team this is, a click on the link of the team name will resolve that confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your second argument is, that \"\"most sources refer to that team as West Germany\"\". That may be right, but is that really the deciding criterion? If i find, that most sources say, that eg Evolution is wrong, and Intelligent Design is right, will that decide the content of a wikipaedia article? I know it's a bad example, and i don't want to provoke a political or offtopic discussion, i just want to make to point that what many people say is not necessarily right. But unlike in discussions about \"\"most sources say Britney Spears is the best singer of all times\"\" this whole thing is not up to taste, political views, scientific surveys, or speculations. It is simply a fact, that the name of the country this team represents is not \"\"West Germany\"\", so it is not right to call the football team that represents this country \"\"West Germany\"\". If you don't believe that this is a fact, then look it up on every government document of the Federal Republic of Germany, the name \"\"West Germany\"\" is never used. And btw: it is not like, there is no source using the proper name of the team. It may not be the majority (i don't know tbh), but i am confident, that i can find a sizeable number of references using the correct term, which will be enough for every passage of this article. German sources use the correct term anyways, i could bombard you with thousands of sources in German language that use \"\"Germany\"\" or \"\"FRG\"\" or \"\"BRD\"\", and not \"\"West Germany\"\". At the end it is the souvereign right of a country to name herself (see also Macedonia vs Greece) and in English the \"\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\"\" has the official name \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" - or short \"\"Germany\"\" - and has never called herself or referred to itself as \"\"West Germany\"\", or \"\"Federal Republic of West Germany\"\" or any other alteration including geographical terms. And the governing body of German football since 1900, the \"\"Deutscher Fußballbund\"\" which translates into \"\"German Football Association\"\" has never called itself \"\"West German Football Association\"\" or referred to its players as \"\"West Germans\"\". As i have already mentioned above, all Germans were eligble to play, whether they are from east or west or south or north. Even Germans born in other countries are eligible, like Paolo Rink born in Brazil, or Miroslav Klose/Lukas Podolski/Piotr Trochowski born in Poland, or Oliver Neuville born in Switzerland, as long as they have German ancestry. \n",

You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.  You must also admit that you were stalking me on WP:  Tell them what mechanism you used, so they know what you did.  (The fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.)\n",

You don't have some sort of automatic, default 'win' authority, at least according to WP rules.  I proceeded to edit, and I have done so.   \"\n",

I wonder how many Christian or Jewish groups would like to walk past a Ganesh or Buddha statue whenever they go to court?  Probably they wouldn't.

Dershowitz was arguing that government should be less entangled in deciding who could get married than it is now, and leave it to the individual religious to decide what marriages are acceptable.

The answer to your first question is no, whites from Liverpool speak Scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from South London, of course, but I don't see what that has to do with White South African English.  However, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  Most blacks from Boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from New Orleans.  Most blacks from both areas speak what's called African American Vernacular English (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in America.

It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't.\n",
      "Finally, I will respond to your earlier comment that \"\"White South African English\"\" as a title for this article is \"\"simply racist\"\".  You really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don't understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That's quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's \"\"simply racist\"\".  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you're saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  Of course, I don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   \"\n",

      "Well there's been a lot said, if I can just address Kolzene's point first. I don't quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones, what would these different articles be? Firstly let's just overview what is already in place, we've got this article: Technocratic movement (and the sub-articles like Technate, etc.), we've got Technocracy (which is just a disambiguation page), Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory). Then we have Network of European Technocrats, which is part of the broader Technocratic movement. So what you're saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article, specifically about that group, detached from the main article in the same way as NET? Well, I suppose that could be done, but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one. What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc. stuff were taken out and put in a different article? I have to say, I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers. Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement. The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term, but it was recently trimmed down to something very small, (which I was against doing BTW). So to start from the beginning, we have the word Technocracy, which has acquired many different meanings, one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists, this is addressed in the Technocracy (bureaucratic) and Technocrat (derogatory) articles and isn't really relevant here. The other meaning, the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc. and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930's. Then NET, which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc., just in Europe, but has adopted it's own ideas, some of which are different to Tech Inc's. I don't really know what is the best way to proceed yet, but I don't think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion.\n",

I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).\n",

The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of \"\"The/the Beatles\"\" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to \"\"the Beatles\"\" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, \"\"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.\"\" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a \"\"shot across the bow\"\" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to \"\"grow the fuck up\"\" and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff! I just can't believe this is happening on WP with all these rules and tough nuts. ) 99.251.125.65  \"\n",

When the word Canton is made into the English adjective Cantonese, it could mean Guangdongese and Guangzhouese. The language people commonly refer to as Cantonese is in fact Guangzhouese. Taishanese people speak Taishanese, a language that is unintelligible with Guangzhouese. Many Taishan people in China still do not speak or understand Guangzhouese. This is the norm in the whole of China concerning regional spoken languages. It is acceptable to say that Taishanese is one of the Guangdongese languages, but then so is Hakka. The conflict is thus not a conflict between a Cantonese (meaning Guangdongese) speaking people against a non-Cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke Cantonese meaning Guangdongese, be it one spoke Taushanese and the other Hakka. Neither party could also be described as Cantonese (meaning Guangzhouese) speaking people as neither were Guangzhouese speakers at home.\n",

I mentioned \"\"less haste, more speed\"\" above, but another saying that might be apt is \"\"less is more\"\".What you do and how you do it is entirely your affair, of course, but one thing I've noticed is that Malleus seems rarely to respond directly to the many posts that you make at his own talk page.

More sources have been given to this article than 1/2 of anything out there on Wikipedia. People like this Starblind love to jump in and switch all the Barbaro family information around, he loves to listen to the advice of novices like genio that have clearly been proven to be wrong. Now I have been called in a geneologist expert, that has been giving you valid sources and information that you can check with ISBN numbers and Web pages etc etc etc, and that is still not good enough. What is going to make you happy. You tell me. What are you looking for? What do you want? The article now has been completely destroyed to nothing. Great work Starblind. Lets just pretend that the web pages to validate the arms that were given just don't exist, right? Let's just pretend that Fallopio is a figment of the world's imagination.  Starbling and this hoaxer are equally immature. When a person provides sources, Met museum evidence, and all of the other things like museum exhibition etc etc etc. What more can you ask for.

      "\n",
      "I see the article IQ reference chart has been tagged for expert review since October 2012. As part of a process of drafting a revision of that article in , I am contacting all Wikipedians who have edited that article since early 2009 for whom I can find a user talk page. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have read all the diffs of all the edits committed to the article since the beginning of 2009 (since before I started editing Wikipedia). I see the great majority of edits over that span have been vandalism (often by I.P. editors, presumably teenagers, inserting the names of their classmates in charts of IQ classifications) and reversions of vandalism (sometimes automatically by ClueBot). Just a few editors have referred to and cited published  reliable sources on the topic of IQ classification. It is dismaying to see that the number of reliable sources cited in the article has actually declined over the last few years. To help the process of finding reliable sources for articles on psychology and related topics, I have been compiling a  since I became a Wikipedian in 2010, and I invite you to make use of those sources as you revise articles on Wikipedia and to suggest further sources for the source on the talk pages of the source list and its subpages. Because the IQ reference chart article has been tagged as needing expert attention for more than half a year, I have opened  discussion on the article's talk page about how to fix the article, and I welcome you to join the discussion. The draft I have in  shows my current thinking about a reader-friendly, well sourced way to update and improve the article. I invite your comments and especially your suggestions of reliable sources as the updating process proceeds.   (talk, )\n",

On another front, I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands, even though I disagree with Heylin's assessment of mid-July, which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 (see Shades, p. 264). I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by \"\"release.\"\" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion. With those three in place, distribution couldn't have been more than a week behind if not already in motion.   \"\n",

That is, by using the 1st stanza as the name (instead of the official name State Anthem of Ukraine) we end up with this: \"\"Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy\"\" (, or \"\"Ukraine's ? hasn't died\"\"), where we have to put ? in the sentence.

Those industries probably have perhaps 80% or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.\n",

      "Major Industrial Distillation Types: The two primary types of industrial distillations are Continuous Fractionation or (Continuous Distillation) and Batch Distillation. The industrial Continuous Fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large, vertical, cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the Fractional distillation article. Please note  that by continuous, I mean 24 hours a day for 1 to 3 years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.\n",

      "The above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary Continuous Fractionation towers. The vacuum towers require reinforcement (provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors) so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the vapor-liquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers, it is virtually impossible to explain bubble-cap or valve trays (or sheet steel structural packing) without drawings or photographs.  We need someone who could make such drawings. We also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettle-type reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a  distillation tower (although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces, horizontal or vertical heat exchangers, bayonet heat exchangers, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if you look at the the simple sketch that I made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the Fractional distillation article, that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream  entry (at about the center height of the tower), and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. -\n",

Now, after evidence of his short hair just one day before your photo was taken has surfaced, you're saying it was a wig.  It doesn't work both ways, and with the evidence against it, it doesn't work either way.  While I'm willing to believe that you believe your photo is T.R.

So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank.

With that in mind there is no argument with you except to say that other users disagree with you and for better or worse will continue to revert the article.  I agree with and support them in so doing.  I further take respectful disagreement with your take that there is personal bias.  Steve Niles is a bad person like Karr is a bad person like Himmler was a bad person.  These are objective standards not subjective ones.  Anyway, you can't WIN this argument anymore than I can convince you that a news source is a news source.

      "\":: Obviously I wasn't referring to \"\"good-faith edits\"\" intended to help people or to help improve the article (we all appreciate those), I was referring to uninformed edits and reverts of edits that added to the article. There's no need to lecture me on wp, thanks for the offer tho - this is the first time that I have seen such aggressive uninformed editing in years. I was not at all trying to \"\"own\"\" the article, what I was trying is making sure that informed edits go through. In case you didn't notice, I previously asked for the article to be LOCKED for public editing, to lock out certain people (including myself!), to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits, while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refs/quoting. At the end of the day, I have given up now - and I won't bother wasting any more time debating things here, as usual, interest will degrade over time and some jackass-type personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later (probably the ones who just happen to be around accident-related articles because of recent news coverage) - at the moment, there's simply too much public interest, and what's happening isn't just a wp-specific issue, there's lots of layman's discussion taking place everywhere, without really adding to the quality of discussion. Finally, what's been happening here wouldn't be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors, where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals, encyclopedic or not. Again, this is nothing personal and against anybody here - I do realize that there are team dynamics at work here, and I have seen tons of editing wars going on here, not just due to my own edits - so I really don't take it personally. But I would hope for wikipedia to adopt some sort of policy, workflow and procedures for such \"\"hot\"\" events, to ensure a higher degree of QA - not just based on wp seniority/status, but based on people who have some related professional background. wp isn't going to fail obviously, but 5-10 years from now, the behavior tolerated here by some \"\"wannabe-experts\"\" will no longer be tolerated, and corresponding procedures will be put in place to differentiate between content and markup contributions.   \n",

      "The addition of \"\"and\"\" is good. However, a force need not be \"\"perceived\"\" to exist. The definition of \"\"acceleration\"\" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it.

I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.\n",
      "Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the \"\"force\"\" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.\n",
      "There is a slight issue here with the sentence: \"\"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.\"\" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a \"\"force\"\" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.\n",

The show does not actually fit the definition of pseudoscience, because it does use the scientific method when doing tests.  They may not run the tests as rigorously as they should for highly reliable results, but the tests are scientific enough for TV.  Furthermore, by Vuo's argument, \"\"horse abuse\"\" doesn't actually use horses.  The show constantly uses science to blow up and otherwise abuse things, so that is another interpretation of \"\"science abuse\"\" that does not indicate pseudoscience.

The most obvious is that it is a clear copyright violation. We cannot ignore copyright violations just because you make a claim that you grant permission. There is no way to know if you are the copyright holder or not. To grant permission we would need the copyright holder to release the work under an appropriate license. The best way to do this would be to tag the original webpage with the license that it is being released under. We obviously can't just accept any editor's word that they are the copyright holder while a clear statement of copyright exists on the original material, if we did anyone could make such a claim for any work and we would not be able to obey the law on copyrights.\n",

You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively.

We do learn that the Amtorian for \"\"of\"\" is \"\"kum.\"\"  Therefore, \"\"liberty\"\" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a \"\"k\"\" anyawy.  So, the group is named the \"\"Kl-something kum K-something,\"\" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.\n",

Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (\"\"What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!

We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.

      "The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from \"\"wrestling\"\", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.\n",
      "\n",
      "My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   \"\n",

In this case, citing sources to prove Mario Kart's notability in comparison to Sonic R could just as well have been done in relative privacy on the talk page, without cluttering up the main article.

A single paragraph description of the content is not the same as a lengthy review. I think the current book descriptions are ok. If some Jws are not happy, why don't they put some 'positive' books in the positive section as a balance? Reducing book descriptions until they are meaningless, or so vague that no one knows what they are about, is a rather surreptitious form of direct censorship, or reader manipulation at the least, and should not be encoraged.

      "\n",
      "There is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.\n",

      "This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, \"\"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon?

I liked him as the Undertaker, but that was back when I thought he was scary in the 90s. I don't have a problem with his badass side, btu I think he should stick to one or another because it's just confusing to me. Oh well, he's probably rich as it gets the way the company praises them like he's God so I suppose it doesn't really matter to him. I just have a problem getting the whole 90s Undertaker vibe when he pulls off his top and raises his arm, then pulls it back on and falls to one knee worshipping the urn and Paul bearer that aren't there. That's another thing, Paul Bearer with all the faces throughout the entrace, pulling off of the coat, using the power of the urn was a big part of that whole character. I think he should just give up on being the Undertaker because he isnt' scarying anyone anymore. That character was a good one that was meant to be scary, not changed into all sorts of rockers.

      "\n",
      "The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella—resident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA—in the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston’s neighboring cities.\n",

Likewise, the statement \"\"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever\"\" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as \"\"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart\"\" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.\n",

There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center.

      " My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use \"\"facts\"\" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT \"\"fact\"\" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video. Perhaps you can find a peer-reviewed article that gives an explanation how PRT can \"\"pay for itself\"\".

For example, DC orginated as an abreviation for direct current - a current that does not periodically reverse direction.  Thus, a phrase like 'DC voltage' becomes 'direct current voltage' which doesn't make much sense at all.  Further, a 'DC current' becomes 'direct current current' which is redundant.  We EEs commonly refer to the DC component of a signal thereby equating the term 'DC' to the time average of a time varying signal or, if we are in the frequency domain, the 0 Hz component of the signal.  Additionally, we talk of DC voltage or current sources when we mean constant voltage or current sources.  Finally, we refer to DC circuits when we mean a circuit without memory (the voltages and currents in the circuit do not depend on past or future values of voltages and currents).  There are probably other examples where the term 'DC' has become shorthand for something other than a uni-directional current.\n",

      "Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94\n",
      "\n",
      "This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\n",
      "\n",
      "Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104\n",

For instance, the Bhagavad Gita define 4 types of yoga - Karma, Jnana, Raja, Bhakti - only one of which (Raja) includes asanas and pranayam. Also, though there is no consensus on this, yoga may have existed even before the Vedas. In either case, the philosophy is definitely there in Vedas and Upanishads (Hindu scriptures), which pre-date Gautama Buddha or Mahavira Jain. It makes complete sense to show the Hinduism info-box on top. Another suggestion is remove the info-boxes altogether. After all, the article also goes on to discuss about influence of yoga on other religions like Islam and Christianity. But showing the info-boxes in an alphabetical order does not make sense.\n",

I do still believe that having to tell a seasoned editor not to warn someone for a minor spelling goof, to check for proper reliable sources, to check for original research in those sources, to check for verifibility, etc. is something I shouldn't have to do with someone who has been an editor for almost 3 years.
